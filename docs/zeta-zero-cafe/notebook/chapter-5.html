A and B are those of the projection and triangular plane. Configuration C is more straightforward, but
configuration D will be the one to take center stage.
The hypotenuse , see table 4.3: The base of Planck&#x27;s constant,

configurations is delimited by exact the value found in the fractal argument for zeta, only here the
relation between angle and radius is significant. In figure 6.2 the radius contracts according to table
5.1: Hexagonal equilibrium, column .
Starting with the hypotenuse , depicted in the shaded square, representing the initial state of the
mathematical universe operated on. One iteration of  further we find radius “1” representing
the continuum  and therefor the shaded area stands model for .
This is the starting point for . The radii stand in specific relation to each
other, they are grouped in sequences of 3 radii , spanning a surface over . This is

Line  is the longest line in our universe and the next iteration gives

universe bounds which would defy the meaning “universe”. The absolute size of the area

continuous relation contained within the mathematical universe. In table 5.1: Hexagonal equilibrium
we find the family of chords that represent sets of points that would appear to express spherical
attributes, see column  containing values proportional to .  In figure 6.3 triangle 
consists of two triangles  and . Line  (see Figure 5.6: Root 2

mistaken because of the fractal argument (section 4. - The fractal argument for zeta) in relation to a
continuously collapsing surface, each iteration expresses a evolutionary stage of the surface and is a
scale invariant measure of the universe. Area , represents the same evolution as
depicted in the projection plane, triangular plane model. Therefor , both lines represent

Necessarily convex
This brings us back to the root of curvature (Figure 5.6: Root 2 equilibrium) where chords are
observable, but must be so in either a Cartesian or Spherical identity because they have to fit the
bounds as a straight line between two vertices in some continues expression without exceeding the
bounds of the universe. In short, the universe is a complete convex set where all edges between
vertices are straight. In spite of that some appear curved because in a Cartesian reference frame the
set of points would appear to project outside the universe, hence those sets are perceived as if having
properties of spherical geometry.
The M-brane exposed area
In figure 6.4 the regression is depicted as successive squares of the radii. Each iterative step is
depicted as a full triangular cycle of . A partition of the area has no overlap
with previous and subsequent areas, those are indicated A through E, measure  of the current
iteration and  of the subsequent iteration.
By symmetry it takes two iterations  reach a 4-fold reduction in
area.
Figure 6.5, by ratio of successive iteration , shows that Surface Area and Volume are
in fact out of phase expressions of surface area.
. Volume is defined as wrapped surface area.
The third iteration is associated with . There if we project a intermediate iteration onto  of the
completed cycle, then we find ourselves at the point depicted in configuration D (Figure 6.1: Some 
affected area configurations). The hypotenuse of the remaining triangular area is

In figure 6.6 it is really more convenient to use the  system. The base of each iteration by scale
invariance is always proportional to 1,
. By design we know that the total area below the hypotenuse is . This we will
express in fractions of 60, .  and therefore remains
. The coordinates for point D are  and
 yielding an area .
The sum of areas  is equivalent to . The radii

The scale invariance of geometric proportions such as  and  means that without frame of
reference the size of the object they are derived from is unknowable.
To complicate matters further, knowing and following algorithms demand agency. There is no such
thing as “agency” in an emergent system rooting in first principle.
What mechanism would be capable of forcing a mathematical abstraction onto physical systems. How
can any physical process take note of any mathematical abstract notion of oscillation and behave
accordingly? Well, it can not, it only appears to stabilize each time while in reality, as we will show, the
collapse is a ongoing process and quantized in discrete pulses. The mathematical structure is
emerging from first principles from within the physical structure, it can be derived from observation.
The fractal argument for zeta just tells us that there exist one specific point at which:
, at which point a equilibrium exists between the (intra
dimensional) interface, surface area is volume and visa versa.
At no point this fact tells us how this can be the cause for any natural process to ‘react to and or
branching of’, no matter if Planck’s constant appears in such a geometric construction.
The real question that comes up is, why does observation of nature led to answers indicative of
constant recurrence of what mathematically seems to express one extremely rare instance in some
continuous flow.  has a very specific role to play in the envisioned structure. The fractal
siblings projection plane  and the triangular plane  represent a continuously
collapsing structure, it is  that represents the configuration that is at the cusp of each
discrete moment in time. Next a proposal for a structure that has exactly the properties sought for will
be detailed, one with an integrate slotting mechanism, the Quadrature Geometric Framework.2–√π
