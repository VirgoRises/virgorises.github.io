Hexagonal chords and Planck
A hexagonal chord has the same dimensions as the radius for the circle it inscribes,
 (Figure 3.4: Primorial hexagon). In table 4.1:
Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane, we find  and , where  by the
closed formula:
Figure 5.1 shows two chords
1. Chord  is a hexagonal chord and related to the triangular projection by the proportion of
side b. In table 4.1: Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane we find
. However, because here we find , the
tuple for  does not represent . Calculating  with this value produces
. Side b is interesting because the absolute value 
conforms to the scale invariant value  present in  hexagonal triangles.
2. , with chord , has side b extended to . This triangle matches the last tuple in the
table, but  does not conform to a  triangle. See table 4.1: Discrete triangular
- Continues projection plane, where we find  and
.

Observe that if we counter intuitively apply the Pythagoras theorem by assuming  as if , then
any  right angled triangle has a ratio  derived by 
. We find Planck’s constant by:
. This is not just a mathematical
coincidence and can be placed in a rigid meaningful context labeled &#x27;Unity chords&#x27; which justifies the
abuse of the Pythagorean theorem. Equation 2 gives the associated values as found in table 4.1:

The unity chords are defined by the hypotenuses in a specific range and the associated right angled
triangles are all assumed to represent a distorted representation of a hexagonal triangle,

Because we assume a distorted representation of a hexagonal triangle in each case, geometrically the
unity chords must have  and be part of right angled triangles with a hypotenuse
, by counter intuitively application of the Pythagoras theorem by treating  as if  of
course. The range in which the unity chords project is wedged between
 and . Observe that the only
natural occurring hexagonal chord wedged between  and  does not occur in the
triangular projection as discrete interval, see table 4.1: Discrete triangular - Continues projection
plane. Note that the area enclosed for all tuples in table 4.1 comes to .
An infinite set of coordinates in between can accommodate such a chord, and therefore unity chords
must exist such that;

For any pair of coordinates  a hypotenuse exists, but only those that occur in the triangular
projection, see table 4.1: Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane conform to the spatial ratio
, see equation 2.7 Spatial ratio. The triangular projection defines a discrete point
of equilibrium between Cartesian area and spherical surface where  and
. One observation is the area of the 1 by 2 rectangle and its diagonal . Let
 be the circumference of a sphere. Then the surface area of that sphere is 
. In this reference frame we have an infinite series of chords
, each marking an iterative step in a cycle projecting the triangular numbers, of which
the third iteration marks of the conclusion of  , see figure 4.1: The sum formula.
Root 2 equilibrium
The ratio  means that for every hexagonal chord the proportionality to Planck’s constant
holds. Which makes this occurrence of Planck’s constant kind of a banality. This will be proven a
feature, not a bug. In context of a  power series we find quite a unique occurrence for the unity
chord. In figure 5.6: Root 2 equilibrium the tuple for n=2 in table 5.1: Hexagonal equilibrium, is
depicted. From the triangles  and , the triangle  does not occur in table 4.1:
Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane, as a triangular projection, but we used it in figure 5.1:
Hexagonal chord versus  and figure 5.2: Planck base - Unity chord. Now in figure 5.6: Root 2
equilibrium the “Unity” aspect that integrates triangle  in the set of periodic chords as
depicted in figure 5.2 comes to light by the association with triangle . Here the first thing to
take note of, is that both triangles in this configuration are indeed hexagonal. The angles
 are both  and  are both . Further, the point of origin
for both triangles is B. It is easy to see that by decreasing segment , labeled , will map both
triangles in one to one correspondence. We recognize the chord  in a somewhat peculiar place for
a hexagonal chord in figure 5.2, namely it is the chord  between  and  that
corresponds with the hypotenuse in figure 4.6: Projection plane extended zeta, at the extend of .
This indicates that triangle  is the end phase of a cycle, in this model the hypotenuse at 
indicates a 4-fold decrement in surface area.

The chord  on the other hand does also associate with the end of a cycle, it is the limit of the
triangular cycle. See  in table 4.1: Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane. The
conclusion must be that both  and  are in fact one and the same, they stand back to back,
occupy the same space, are merely separated by choice of perspective. One way of looking at it is to
assume that both triangles  and  are conjoined along their chords and model a
spherical triangle as depicted in figure figure 5.7: Spherical triangle. Together they can be envisioned
to form , but will encompass in fact the entire surface area because of the scale invariant
property of volume. This in turn will clarify again the surface area vs volume equilibrium as shown in
figure 4.9: Projection plane regression. The associated surface area ratio is

Curvature and the plane
The ordening of triangular numbers in the triangular plane raises the question what a number
precisely entails. In the limit  consists of all natural numbers counting of all
triangular numbers. This is also the case for the hypotenuse c which has exactly as many members as
the sides a and b by nature of their arrangement. This makes all sides of the triangle in count of
represented numbers equally sized. We identified chords  and  as two expressions of one and
the same chord (Figure 5.6: Root 2 equilibrium) and the process in which segment  decreases until
in the limit both triangles are in a one to one correspondence. The moment that the chords  and
 merge into 1, numerically a equilateral triangle  is realized where 
.
In numerical sense this configuration resembles a  right angled polar triangle on a spherical
surface (fig. 5.7), three angles that is, total  where the area itself represents the
complete count of Natural numbers.
Such a triangle fits 8 times on the surface of a sphere and this must mean that the Surface area is a
scale invariant model of volume. This clearly is the point of equilibrium, the surface area is at the point
of  and in the configuration as depicted in figure 4.9: Projection plane regression. This
configuration can only be depicted as a square surface area  because the moment this
configuration is reached, the only measure in this new state of our mathematical universe is the size of→a= lim

the chords spanning the surface as great circles. And already established was that “The hypotenuse
from  to  is off course  and longer lines, that represent the root
of a square area, do not exist in our universe.” (see subsection root-of-a-square-area).
The root of curvature
The root of curvature, or at least the sense there is such a thing as curvature, is illustrated in figure 5.6:
Root 2 equilibrium. At any given moment the universe is in a state where the chords  and  are
simultaneously observable, measurable, but can only be recognized in there distinct identity as either
Cartesian or part of spherical geometry. In this figure the spherical identity must be from chord
 because the length exceeds the maximum length feasible in our mathematical universe.
Conjoining both chords leaves us with two possible configurations to represent those chords, 1) as
hypotenuse  dividing the cartesian area in two, or 2) as great circle c=2pi dividing the surface
area of two hemispheres.
The scale invariant ratios “square root of two” and the “circumference of a circle” are one and the
same entity.
The projection plane measures  with a hypotenuse .
The unit surface area is  with an associated circumference of , and
yields a ratio 
Because a surface area is defined by  and this area is subdivided in 8 polar triangles the
relative radius for a surface area  is  , or with
 In table 5.1: Hexagonal equilibrium the schema is based on a root 2
power series  and it is the triangular number cycle irrespective of
coordinate system, reference frame, that iterates in continuous perpetuity through that cycle. In table
4.1: Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane the cycle starts with  and ends with
, in what seems a infinity of iterative steps reducing the radius.
A perpetual reducing radius produces a surface area that has a unique radial length for each separate
surface coordinate it intersects. For regular spherical surfaces this will mean a stack of identical x and
y coordinates at each unique radial distance. It is in the continuous regression of surface area that lays
a clue hinting at a 2 dimensional surface structure that wraps around a singularity, the surface
asymptote found earlier. Figure 5.8 is a model of one hemisphere of such a surface. A Cartesian flat
version will be presented. The 2D surface itself stands model for a 3D space spiraling in on itself, any
radius intersecting this spiral stands orthogonal on 3D space.
This is a M-brane mono surface with a bulk (void) separating the surface layers wrapping over and
over. The shape of the surface area of this (two hemisphere) structure, given the bulk infinitely thin
and ignoring the subsurface spiral, is approaching that of a sphere. With the singularity as center of
this structure, any perfect sphere with fixed radius will cut as a ghost through this surface and only
have two (2) coordinates in common with that surface, those are the conjoined surface coordinate(s)
 and the coordinate at the absolute center B, see figure 5.6: Root 2 equilibrium.x=2–√−1y=2–√−1c=a =12–√

Unity orthogonal to the sphere
Taking another look at figure 5.6: Root 2 equilibrium it becomes clear what is represented. As 
shortens  approaches the point at which  stands orthogonal to the surface of the sphere. As
that point is reached then  and  share the same radius. There is one aspect to take note of
and that is the angle.  and  are at that point orthogonal to the surface of the sphere, however,
no radius can be orthogonal to the surface of the M-brane. A better way to look at it is that because
the sphere only intersects the spiral at one point, a continuous decreasing radius will visit each
coordinate at the spiral without exception. At certain radial distances it must be the case that the
shared coordinate is at the point of equilibrium, see figure 4.9: Projection plane regression and table
4.4: Zeta, the SA/Volume equilibrium. In principle the decreasing radius paints the surface of the spiral
as a space filling curve, linear and missing no spot. This is what we see expressed in figure 5.6: Root 2
equilibrium, only from that perspective it is the spheres surface being painted, after all, we are dealing
with an infinite set of orthogonal unity chords, see figure 5.2: Planck base - Unity chord for
. The question to ask is however, “did you not notice your radius decreasing?”CE¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
