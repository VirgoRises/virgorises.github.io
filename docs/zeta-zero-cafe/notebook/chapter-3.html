The triangular numbers
A triangular number or triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle, [...]. The nth
triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with n dots on a side and is
equal the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n.
Mapping the sum formula
The sum formula mapped as in figure 4.1 is a rather naive graphical representation of the zeta
function value for . Is the infinite sum of reciprocal squares connected to the triangular numbers?
The final result after adding the whole infinity of reciprocal squares can be represented as such, but
does it offer any explanatory powers to do so?
Mathematical universe
The triangular numbers and the zeta function are mathematical abstractions that can not in them
selves exhibit dynamical behavior, nonetheless, we find that the under laying numerical sequence
does reflect some tangible dynamical process. The conclusion therefor must be that numerical
abstraction necessarily depends on, derives from, what is considered to be the physical nature of the
world we observe. Overall we find that it seems as if observing a dynamic structure in a continues
state of collapse. In fact this notion of mathematics emerging from physical reality and state of
collapse is exactly what needs to be modeled for the hypothesis to be correct.Tn

Figure &#x27;The sum formula and first six triangular numbers&#x27; showing the area  divided in 4
quadrants represents the mathematical universe, a complete convex set, Wikipedia:A complete convex
set. The figure does not have explanatory power for the dynamic behavior, that will be handled in
chapter 7. In this chapter the apparent fractal property of self-similarity and dynamic fingerprint will
be identified, the lower left () quadrant will be shown to represent the end state of the area as a
whole.
The Planes
Projection Plane
The projection plane  (fig. 4.2) measures , subdivided into 4 quadrants, numbered from
the top right, anticlockwise I, II, III and IV. This plane is assigned a scale with sides of length  and
thus defines the projection plane to , i.e. the continuum .
The marker  on the x-axis, (also projects on the y-axis), marks the extend of an isosceles right
angle triangle measuring . Similarly the two arcs at  and  define the
two hypotenuses,  as upper bound and  as lower bound, below which the triangular
numbers project as area of the continuum , also as isosceles right angle triangles.A=π2

Triangular Plane
The rational projection of the triangular numbers is contained within the limits of quadrant III, the
triangular plane  (see fig. 4.3).
The set of numbers , triangular number , projects on a  grit from
the lower left corner up to and over the diagonal running from upper left to lower right, e.g., the 
projection of  results in a grit of 9 squares of which 6 are occupied.
Affected area for n is 3
See table 4.1 discrete triangular continues projection plane. Each triangular number can be expressed
as a set of discrete areas, e.g. the 6 filled squares in the  grid contained in quadrant III for n=3.
The total affected area can be expressed in relation to:
The projection plane: 
The triangular plane: 
Proportion above hypotenuse
Except for the limiting case , there is a portion of the affected area that projects above the
hypotenuse of quadrant III. The sum of the triangles projected above the hypotenuse also add up to
an area, for  this adds up to:
Proportional to the projection plane: 
Proportional to the triangular plane: 
Affected area in the limit
At  the affected area is infinite dense, solely consisting of dimensionless points. In
the limit there is no affected area remaining above the hypotenuse, and the affected area is
. In this configuration the hypotenuse of the affected area will be

Triangular projection to Surface Area
The area projected by square area units in the triangular plane , can also be represented by a
continuous triangular section of the projection plane  as a whole with right angle sides (note the
emphasis) .
Such a projection for the triangular numbers will exceed the bounds of quadrant III for all triangular
numbers with exception for the limiting case which projects on the diagonal of quadrant III, see fig.
F4.04 triangular to projection plane.
The hypotenuse of  has length: . The
hypotenuse at  sections off exactly the affected area as shown in the triangular projection
. In essence providing a continuous representation of the discrete triangular projection.
By this procedure both  and  are mapped to the projection plane.
The emphasis on &#x27;with right angled sides&#x27; has a purpose, a triangle number counts objects arranged in
an equilateral triangle and not in a right sided triangle.
Hybrid right and equilateral triangle
There is one aspect that makes the right angled projection a model for a equilateral triangle and that is
the arrangement of the triangular numbers. Note that  projects 3 unit squares along the x and y
axis, but also 3 units along the diagonal. The projection is equilateral when expressed in numbers of
units.

projected as continuous area.
In the the total area below the hypotenuse for  is . The remainder of the shaded
area between  and the limit at  measures .
The process starts with  and this area reduces as the cycle
approaches , a difference of , which in the triangular
projection for  is the part of the affected area exceeding the hypotenuse of the triangular plane,
e.g., .
Area accounting in the plane
The Bernoulli brothers found proof for the divergence of the harmonic series,
. Consider that the triangular number  projects in a  grid in
the triangular plane and has , and furthermore that the harmonic series is
equivalent to .
In table 4.1 discrete triangular continues projection plane, we find that the maximum affected area is
. Table 2.1 zeta function values, lists “no value” for , the harmonic series. However, in this
particular reference frame a definite closed value can be assigned to the harmonic series by
completing the pattern:
This needs to be justified for . Considering that the mathematical universe is , where do the
function values  project on the projection/triangular plane? The answer is intriguing, first
the context for  should be clear. Table 4.1 discrete triangular continues projection plane, shows
three sections, connecting Cartesian triangular projection and associated spherical geometry.

Section : “Discrete” lists the area affected, “Continue” lists the associated right
angle sides  for the projection (fig. 4.04 triangular to projection plane), onto the projection plane.
section : “Closed” lists the from “n” derived “intermediate radius” as the closed
formula , the “Calculated” value for  is derived from the ratio to which the
limit is approached, .
Then finally section : the conversion of the “intermediate radius” using the
primorial structure.
Listed is the proportional surface area associated with the radius . By ratio
 we find that the mapping for  relates to  by application of the primorial
ratios  and .
The progression from  to the limit a=0.5 can be, evidently, expressed as a ratio ,
which has as closed form . Table 4.1, shows that the primorial ratios reflect some
intimate connection between two distinct worlds, the flat Cartesian triangular projection and the
curved surface area of spherical geometry. At , table 4.1, we find that the affected triangularTriangularplane AΔ

The value for  in column  lists , this result hints at a fractal property if
interpreted as a result of dynamic behavior, but does not confirm conclusively that  is
valid.
The interpretation of  is that it indicates a previous cycle of  when the ratio
affected cells for the triangular plane reached .
The fraction  is associated with the affected area of the triangular plane  in the third quadrant of
the projection plane  resulting from , and here we find this configuration superimposed
on the projection plane  as if it is the triangular plane.
At  the affected area of the projection plane  is , mirroring the triangular plane  at .
The value , indicates that both projection plane and triangular plane are projections of the
same area  at two distinct moments of some recursive process.
The configuration/function value  seems to represent some equilibrium.
Changes in Surface Area
The triangular cycle  only holds  for , values for  are not
represented within the triangular cycle. Those values cannot be mapped as triangular number grid in
quadrant III, however, the values can be mapped as affected area in the mathematical universe of .
In table 4.1 discrete triangular continues projection plane, we find that the value for  coincides
with  and a proportional .
At the start of the triangular cycle we find , the total increment in the range
 is therefor .ζ(s=1) SA∝π2SA∝6

The projection for  (see table 4.2 projection plane range for all s) yields the radius for a sphere
with  which is an increment in surface area by a factor  in the range
.
However, because the values for  fall outside the bounds of the triangular projection, we
established that the mapping to  does not apply.
In stead, those values indicate the projection to some future state in a continuous collapse of surface
area. The values for  for the Projection plane/Triangular plane assembly can be interpreted as
reflecting a relative position/distance removed from the current equilibrium at value . In this
sense the triangular numbers projected onto the projection plane  can be interpreted as a scale
invariant snapshot of any stage in hypothesized state of continuous collapse. Which, of course, implies
that for this to be true, also the natural numbers  must be interpreted as a set of labels
attached to relative positions on a gliding scale.
For now we assume this dynamical aspect as a given, and proceed under the assumption that this
geometric model represents a phase shift in the mathematical universe that, during hypothesized
collapse, geometrically fixates the relative positions of those labels.
Bounds of the phase shift
The phase shift projects within static bounds on the projection plane .
We find values for  (see table 4.2 projection plane
range for all s). As found previously, the scale factor  is key because the triangular plane, or
rather quadrant III it projects in, is clearly the scale invariant continuation of the projection plane .
We see that with respect to scale, . The apparent increment in surface area from
 to  between  and  is, however, a dynamical interpretation imposed on what
essentially is a mathematical abstraction, so there must be some real world context in which proposed
phase shift can be identified as part of some dynamical process in space/time reality.
In chapter 8 a proposal to explain the nature of this phase shift will be formulated, and a relation will
be identified between the conservation laws, the nature of vacuum energy and the cosmological
constant .
First identify the static numerical pattern that seems to occurs at the point of equilibrium for the ratio
affected area: For the projection plane , numerator and denominator are  For the
triangular plane , numerator and denominator are .
Thus the increase of the affected area progresses in a  ratio (see eq. 2.17 spatial ratio).
which indicates the total affected area of  must be , or corrected for scale in-
variance,  for each iteration.
The total affected area of  is therefore  and therefor justifies .ζ(∞)

Longest root of a square area
The affected area  gives the maximum value for the right angled side of the projection
plane ; . The hypotenuse from  to  is off
course , the hypotenuse of the mathematical universe , Longer lines that
represent the root of a square area, do not exist in our mathematical universe.
Further in this chapter a connection is made between this longest line and Planck&#x27;s constant, 
. Longer lines representing the root of a square area would imply that
the count of elements , which is nonsensical.
The maximum right angled side value for the affected area projection is 
.
Continuing the cycle brings us at ratio  or  for a total affected
area of , the ratio stays the same  ad infinitum.
This seems to confine us to an infinite cycle during which only , and by completing the pattern
, play a roll within the bounds of the infinite series of .
Volume independent of number
The maximum size of the right angled side is . In the limit  the
right angled sides contain each , but also the hypotenuse  (see subsection
Triangular_projection_to_Surface_Area). All 3 sides count  elements of equal area. Application
of the multiplication factor  to account for “absolute size” measured over the  hypotenuse
makes no sense, this because in the limit both the straight angled sides and the hypotenuse consist of
an equal number of dimensionless points and therefor represent lines of equal length, i.e. forming a
distorted equilateral triangle. There is a limit beyond , out of reach for the window
provided by , see table  - &#x27;Projection plane range for all s&#x27;. There for s=2 we find that 
 and we know that the limit for the triangular projection is:
 i.e. the length of triangular plane  sides a and b, effectively the lower limit
reached by the triangular projection. For all  the values for  overshoot the lower
limit  e.g.
.
This can be understood as a function of volume,  affected area as limit implies the reduction of a
volume by cutting its radius in half, . To find values in the range
 must, by completing the pattern, imply this fraction is addressing a volume
that is part of a secondary cycle, one that further reduces to .=100AΔ

However, in the limit the current cycle resets numerically back to the start of infinity, see eq.. This
occurs because, as hypothesized, the frame of reference presented by the zeta function consists of a
static numerical pattern of affected surface area at the point of equilibrium .
Outside the limit
Not all hypotenuses are created equal. Al values  result in
, i.e. the resulting hypotenuse is . These values
represent the complete range of the triangular projection cycle (fig. projection plane extended zeta).
The limit for the triangular projection in , , is geometrically hard coded by the premise
that the triangular projection has to be a grid of  overlay-ed on , such that it completely fills
quadrant III of the projection plane .
Figure projection plane extended zeta depicts a shaded area between the hypotenuse at  and
the hypotenuse at , this is the projection domain for .
The first value that projects outside the cycle is  and the
last .
For values of  the resulting affected surface area consists of insufficient
dimensionless points to generate a triangular grid of .
For all function values  an associated surface area exists, each of those have right angled sides
 in the projection plane. However, lacking a reference frame like the projection/triangular
plane assembly would make it impossible to say if this surface area is defined by a mapping to , or
falls outside the static bounds of the phase shift. In such case all hypotenuses do seem to be created
equal.
This is not a trivial observation, because it brings us to the Riemann hypothesis, can it simply be that a
proof for the Riemann hypothesis, ‘All non trivial zeros have real part one half’, is unobtainable
because the tool of complex analysis simply lacks the proper reference frame to distinguish between
classes of non trivial zeros? In chapter 7 a proposition to answer this question will be formulated.
Zeta at the limit, the surface asymptote
The range for the triangular numbers is , in this range only the values for  and
 occur as discrete projection of :
The values for  project to quadrant III of the projection plane , but not in its triangular
plane  identity because the value is out of bounds for . However, the argument
for scale invariance still applies, quadrant III scales to . the shaded area , lays beyond

Completing the pattern analogues to  gives

. The associated radius for the sphere is
 and yields a surface area of  (see table
4.2 projection plane range for all s). A factor  bigger than our universe, the projection plane.
Because some collapsing surface area is assumed, the scale factor  needs to be observed.
The algorithm produces for s=1, .
For s=2, .
This means that the initial configuration of  is also the final configuration of , this is sufficient
to describe the recursion in terms of the phase shift with exclusion of the values for . Likewise
the result for  is a factor 4 to big. Therefore  scales to
the universe.
Plugging in this value produces a surface area . This is a significant result
because  is exact the area that exceeds the hypotenuse of the triangular plane for ,

The value  completes the pattern for  and seems sufficiently
justified.
Crucial is that only  maps to a discrete solution in . Also does  but this is by completing
the pattern.
What is special about  operating on a unit surface area  is the ratio .
Herein we find a profound key to the solution, one that is of significance in connecting the dots
between  and physics.
The transition  can be interpreted as a function of volume but  is expressed as a
function of (surface) area. At the function value of  a unique point of equilibrium occurs that sits
at the source of the emergence of Planck’s constant .
The projection plane exposes a point of equilibrium between volume and surface area, , at which
Surface Area and Volume can be recognized as expressions of one underlying principle. Table 4.3 the

iteration in the lower left cell of quadrant III occupies  of the affected area of quadrant III. If we
assume the recursive product  then for each iteration we find
that the ratio affected area  must have the scale invariant ratio , i.e. represent

This results in a regression pattern where the values appear to project in a region  of the universe
measuring . This proportion can be interpreted as a volume wrapped by a (continuously
reducing) surface area.

The function  represents the scale invariant ratio of affected surface area and/or volume,
where volume is defined by . Realizing that each second iteration results in  of
the initial  it is of course not discernible whether there exist such thing as an even or odd
cycle, for all intends and purposes .
What must be true is that each iterative step results in a scale invariant projection of the universe that
is expressed by  as fraction of surface area. If  then we find that volume and
surface area are interchangeable, see table 4.3 the base of Planck&#x27;s constant,

This is a fractal,  (fig. projection plane regression), at which point a
equilibrium exists between surface area and volume. Surface area is expressed as

Here the scale invariance is preserved where each regressive step is proportionally equal to the
former and the overlap is 1/9 of the completed square.
The pattern is self-similar in regression (fig. projection plane regression) where each iteration is the
application of  on the area representing the scale invariant universe .
In figure 4.10 the same regression is depicted, only this time the scale invariance is preserved where
each regressive step is proportionally equal to the former and the overlap is  for the completed
square. This stacking will lead to exposing the connection between the zeta zero&#x27;s and prime numbers.
The base of Planck&#x27;s constant , (table 4.3 the base of plancks constant)
