Wikipedia: The continuum hypothesis
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis)
There is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and
the real numbers.
Wikipedia: The cardinality of the continuum
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_of_the_continuum)
In set theory, the cardinality of the continuum is the cardinality or
&quot;size&quot; of the set of real numbers  , sometimes called the continuum.
It is an infinite cardinal number and is denoted by  (lowercase fraktur
&quot;c&quot;) or 
The real numbers  are more numerous than the natural numbers .
Moreover,  has the same number of elements as the power set of .
Symbolically, if the cardinality of  is denoted as , the cardinality of
the continuum is
This was proven by Georg Cantor in his uncountability proof of 1874,....
The inequality was later stated more simply in his diagonal argument
in 1891. Cantor defined cardinality in terms of bijective functions: two
sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there exists a bijective
function between them.
Between any two real numbers a &lt; b, no matter how close they are to
each other, there are always infinitely many other real numbers, and
Cantor showed that they are as many as those contained in the whole
set of real numbers. In other words, the open interval (a,b) is
equinumerous with .....
Bijection from N, over Q to R
Cantor defined cardinality in terms of bijective functions: two sets have the
same cardinality if, and only if, there exists a bijective function between
them.
Between the set of rational numbers  and natural numbers  exists a bijection, those can be put in
a one to one correspondence using Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument). However, between the set of real
numbers  and natural numbers  such a bijection is not believed to be possible.R

The argument &#x27;Between any two real numbers a &lt; b, no matter how close they are to each other, there
are always infinitely many other real numbers,...&#x27; we do not dispute. The diagonal argument, for
instance, is restricted to ordering numbers in the two dimensional plane. Inhere we do not propose
that a bijection can be found by ordering in n dimensional space, in stead a more profound method is
discovered by examining the progressive sum of inverse primorials.
Chapter 3, The primorial function, produces a counterexample to CH that hinges on, keep the door
open for now, the equivalence  and thus because  is countable infinite also  must be, if
 holds.
Hidden sqare root of 2
The primorial function is similar to the factorial function for the natural numbers but involves the
product over the primes.
Table 3.01 Primorial root 2 approach
Table 3.01 has 7 columns, column 1 to 4 are the row number &#x27;n&#x27;, the nth prime number
, the consequtive primorials  and the
inverse of the primorials . Column 5, , is the progressing
sum of primorials that seems to approach, but falls short of . This column
hints at a deeper structure underlaying the sum/product equality, where a sum over the natural
numbers equates a product over the primes.
Column 6,  shows the discrepancy between column 5, the progressive sum, and .
The limit of this column states a closed formula, , a.k.a. the square root of the quadrature
constant . Column 5, , will have a limit of 
Finally column 7 identifies the row as upper- or lower-bound (ub or lb), which will become clear in

Strange real attractor, or imaginary rational limit
The quadrature constant (qc) is the stick that puts distance between rational and real values.
But figure 3.01 IS a bijection that scales with : , and does so in a direct fasion,
skipping over an infinity of rational numbers, , that lay between the paired dimensionless
points, e.g., . This does not conform to the currently held
theory which assumes that a limit exist where the real number x occupies a dimensionless point,
which point is not reachable by a finite number of rational (discrete) intermittend steps.Q3.125∈Q↔π∈R

Wikipedia: Dedekind cut
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut),constructing real numbers
A typical Dedekind cut of the rational numbers  is given by the partition
 with
,
This cut represents the irrational number  in Dedekind&#x27;s construction.
The essential idea is that we use a set , which is the set of all rational
numbers whose squares are less than 2, to &quot;represent&quot; number , and
further, by defining properly arithmetic operators over these sets (addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division), these sets (together with these
arithmetic operations) form the familiar real numbers.
The definition of the real number , as wedged between the set A for which
, and set B for which , containing al rational
numbers who&#x27;s square is less then 2. This is an algorithm that seeks to identify a unique real number
that in essence is analogues to &#x27;a coordinate that occupies space between two adjacent coordinates at
Planck length distance&#x27;.
The radial argument, diffuse coordinates
The continuum hypothesis tels us that a straight line segment, like the individual chords of a closed
polygon, represents the continuum. So also does the (perfect) circle.
We construct a circle with a radius of , a  scale model of the unit circle. The
circumference is  and consists of an infinity of dimensionless
points. Then we construct a circle at a radius of , the circumference is
.
Figure 3.02 ( for illustration purposes not to scale), is a scaled down version, , and thus a unit
circle lined with a filament between  that in the QGF is named . In physics this lining
filament is the extent of the convex set shaping our universe. A dynamic version of the that can
only exist in physical reality, and must be inferred from the QGF.
Now we add a radial of width 1 dimensionless point from  to , and rotate
anticlockwise.
Then we rotate by a set number of degrees, or radians, to project to a position and analyze from there.
Figure 3.02 (not to scale), is a model of the unit circle. At , the circumference is both in ratio to
the radius, as well as real number length .
This changes when we modify the radius to . The proportional ratio radius to circumference
maintains , but the circumference can now be stated as . Also for

Although the circumferences differ in geometric length, the radial (1 dimensionless point thick) seems
to indicate, because  spans the whole continuum in both cases, that the same dimensionless point
references both  and . Afterall, the only method available for addressing the dimensionless
coordinates  and  on both circumferences is by means of angle bisecting the circle, and it seems
that both share the same angular property.
The argument might be that the  circle is &#x27;diffuser in partition&#x27; than the  circle, and one cant be
sure to address 3.125 at that angle is not realy convincing. Figure F3.01 Quadrature constant - leap,
allready shows that  or  or  is jumped. The method here is
not to get arbitrarely close to  or perform a Dedekind cut to cunningly isolate the rascal by pure logic.
This &#x27;method&#x27; is more like crossing the bulk wormhole style, as if being really one coordinate.
The circumference at  can be envisioned as an inscribed polygon of , each the width
of a dimensionless point, but &#x27;linear chords&#x27; nonetheless?
In figure F3.02
It seems that in this case &#x27;pointlike&#x27; and &#x27;linear&#x27; is a distiction whithout a difference. Not because we
will not accept abstract mathematics, but because the Quadrature Geometric Framework (QGF) is
based on a first principle that arises with physical reality. The consequence is that where mathematical
abstraction allows for defining arbitrary length scales, nature seems to be restricted by the Planck
length. As mentioned before discussing the Dedekind cut, an algorithm that seeks to identify a unique
real number that in essence is analogues to &#x27;a coordinate that occupies space between two adjacent
coordinates at Planck length distance&#x27;.
The sets  and  are only distinct in mathematical appearance, but do so because they express
different topological points of view in physical expression, i.e. the proposed equivalence  is
obscured by a horizon problem.
The QGF provides the geometric mathematical model for understanding the zeta zeros as chords of n-
gon, but those geometric chords cannot exist outside the bounds of the radius , which defines
the bounds of the convex set. The inference must be that those chords exist in the narrow
confinement of , the &#x27;lining&#x27; of the convex set.
The base of the QGF
At  the radian crossing the two circles adressess two dimensionless points, one at
, and the other in . The same holds arguably for other angles like those
addressing .

The real horizon
At (x,y) coordinate (2 π ,0) a &#x27;horizon&#x27; is defined which is considered unreachable by rational increments
alone. In essence this is what the topological argument for real numbers tells us.
Wikipedia: Real numbers and topological properties
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number#Real_numbers_and_topolog
ical_properties)
The rationals are a dense subset of the real numbers: every real number has
rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is that rational
numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions as regular continued
fractions.
There is discussion whether a more fundamental theory exists replacing the real numbers.πrad

Wikipedia: Real numbers in physics
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#In_physics)
In physics In the physical sciences, most physical constants such as the
universal gravitational constant, and physical variables, such as position,
mass, speed, and electric charge, are modeled using real numbers. In fact,
the fundamental physical theories such as classical mechanics,
electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, general relativity and the standard
model are described using mathematical structures, typically smooth
manifolds or Hilbert spaces, that are based on the real numbers, although
actual measurements of physical quantities are of finite accuracy and
precision.
Physicists have occasionally suggested that a more fundamental theory
would replace the real numbers with quantities that do not form a
continuum, but such proposals remain speculative.
Primorial hexagon and rational numbers
As shown the circumference of our constructed circle is . This is normalized
in figure F3.02 ( for illustration purposes not to scale), to , and thus a unit circle lined with a
fillament between  (QGF ).
In figure F3.04 Primorial hexagon, the construction starts with a unmarked ruler and a set of
compasses.
A x-axis is drawn, a point is chosen and a circle drawn. Then a vesica pisces is constructed, and the
orthogonal crossing the x-axis drawn. The crossing point clearly disects the vesica pisces and has

The maximum extend of the unit circle radius is . And the inverse
,
This gives us a convenient formula for locating the x coordinate in the QGF for the n n-gon:
, e.g. .
The set of natural numbers in the QGF is in fact a subset of the rational numbers . This is because
the unit circle has its pole at . Thus , and therefore 6 projects at
.
This means that  are out of sync with the usual spacing of  that confirms with attributing
intervals of .
The interval in the QGF with respect to the continuum is the now familiar
.
The unit, in the QGF, for natural numbers is ${QGF}{Un\thinspace\in\thinspace\mathbb{N}}=\frac{4}
{25} {QGF}{U}=\frac{1}{25}
{QGF}_{U}=\frac{n\thinspace\in\thinspace \mathbb{QGF}}{4}$.
It is confusing at the least that because of this discrepancy the interval  seems to deviate
a scale factor of 0.96 from the unit radius of the enclosing QGF. However, the interval , still
scales seamlessly with .
Figure F7.04 QGF natural state normalized pole, shows that all the action that in the QGF model
projects between 0 and 2.5, in fact should be scaled down by a factor 2.5, and project between
