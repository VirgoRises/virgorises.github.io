The partial sum of the inverse primorials  approaches the inverse square root of 2,
, but falls short by some factor. The primorial delta  is the discrepancy
between  and the limit of  which has a closed form  :
Prime grouping
The grouping of the primes in an upper and lower bound, column , becomes apparent by analyzing
the partial sum increment for each step with respect to the total increment so far. To apply the
progressive sum, an additive function, over the primorial function, a multiplicative function, is inspired
by the sum/product equality where a sum over the integers is equal to a product over the primes:
Table 3.02 Primorial lb/ub oscillation
Table 3.2 lists the partial sum increment for each row in table 3.1 in the column .
1. , the consecutive primes
2. , upper and lower bound alternating odd / even n
3. , the step wise increment in  from previous to current row
4. , the ratio between the  for grouped rows 
5. , the ratio between the first row and current row

The partial sum increment, lb/ub oscillation, shows a peculiar alternating progression. The clear
oscillation between a upper and lower bound follows from taking the current partial sum
 minus the increment so far . The column 
contains the ratio between lower and upper bound for each group. Column  contains
the progressive ratio between the current  row pair with respect to the ratio of the first  row pair,
.
The quadrature constant
The square of  is defined as the quadrature constant.
The partial sum increment, , table 3.2, shows a peculiar alternating progression. The
current partial sum  minus the increment so far, oscillates between a lower and a upper
bound of approximately  and . The upper and lower bounds alternate row by row and
group the primes like , etc. in some periodic fashion.
For the first two terms  the ratio is exact, , the last two terms in the table 
approach . The primorials, and thus the inverse and sum thereof, are
rational values. The ratio lb/ub will, by the topological property of the real numbers, approach ,
but must be a rational approximation. By application of the derived quadrature constant  the
limit can be determined to be exactly . The quadrature constant  indicates that
a one to one correspondence exist between the Rational numbers , and Real numbers  such that:

The set of rational numbers  is countable infinite and can be paired with the natural numbers ,
which implies that if the hypothesis is correct, the real numbers  are also countable infinite.
Figure 3.01 Quadrature constant - leap
Pairing, not by in the limit approaching arbitrarily close to a partner, but rather leap frogging over an
infinity of real and rational numbers (see fig. 3.1) to a distinct value.
Mapping the continuum
Figure 3.02 Quadrature continuum
Apparently the &#x27;width of a coordinate&#x27;, on a circumference encodes some property other than
&#x27;gradient in spread of arc&#x27;.
Picture 3.2 shows, not to scale, the outer circle  at radius , and the inner circle  at radius
. Both circumferences represent the continuum  but both differ in length due to the
difference in radius.
For every arbitrary small change in angle the radius cuts each circle in exactly 1 distinct dimensionless
coordinate . This is counter-intuitive, how can the coordinate be dimensionless if circumferences
that differ in length are divided up in essentially the same number of coordinates?
We see that at  radius 1 gives  and for radius  it is
. Apparently the &#x27;width of a coordinate&#x27;, on a circumference encodes some
property other than &#x27;gradient in spread of arc&#x27;.
Because radii intersect concentric circles at , a dimensionless point, this leads to a intimate and
unique connection between the sets  and . The circle is the continuum , and measures .
The quadrature constant  provides a smooth mapping from  to  if we define  as a circle
with radius , and  as a circle with radius . A rotation over  results for radius 1
in  and for radius  to .
Apparently the radius has a curvature distorting the observers view such that discrete rational number
intervals seem to spread out and project as indeterminable (irrational) real number values.(∀x∈R)(∃!q∈Q)(x =q) (↬)−1(03.06)

As if a number-theoretical uncertainty principle exists with a horizon  projected at a factor
 from any arbitrary point chosen in .
There exist a observational limit at radius  which transforms any discrete interval in what seems to
be a continuum of real numbers.
If we choose position at , or  from the horizon at , we snap back on the grid of
rational coordinates at . Both coordinates  and  map to the exact same coordinate but only
differ by perspective.
Apparently distinct rational inputs map to distinct irrational outputs because intrinsically . This
is a bold statement that brings the validity of the continuum hypothesys into question, therefor needs
to be justified.
Quadrature reference frame
Figure 3.03 Quadrature reference frame
Figure 3.3 is a Cartesian construction with compass and (unmarked) straightedge. The construction
simply begins with straight line &#x27;A&#x27;, a random point &#x27;B&#x27;, and a circle centered on &#x27;B&#x27; of as yet
undetermined radius. Now define the radius to  and construct &#x27; &#x27; and &#x27; &#x27;.
Proceed by constructing the square. This results in a square and circle of approximately the same
area.
Transcendental numbers are not constructible with a set of compasses and (unmarked) straight edge
(Wikipedia: Constructible number), but in this reference frame we are able to construct an exact
solution for .
In a strict Cartesian sense, clearly , however, we did not simply declare , but rather
defined a geometric context in which the equality exist. Assuming the hypothesis correct this is

Primorial 24 parts in 25 and hexagons
Each distinct dimensionless point (coordinate) addressed on area  maps to exact one, yet
indeterminable fuzzy surface like, &#x27;distributed coordinate&#x27; on the area . This aspect of &#x27;fuzzy spread&#x27;
is closely related to the distribution of the (non trivial) zeros of the Riemann zeta function for which
later a model will be presented.
The outline of that model starts with defining the geometry in which to place the quadrature constant
. The placement is almost derived in figure Quadrature reference frame, point . In fact
, which is in fact the horizon, or observational limit at radius .
Point &#x27;F&#x27; functions as a pole at radius  and is the reference point from which all  are
calculated. The primorial delta  (see table 3.2) defines the x-coordinate 
in figure 3.4 Primorial hexagon.
We find in fact that the x-axis can be subdivided in exactly 25 parts of , and that ,
which makes the pole a  scale unit circle.
The pole at  can therefore be unambiguously constructed starting from any inscribed hexagon
which, enforced by , projects at  within this geometric framework. Lastly, observe that the
inverse of the primorial delta, multiplied by the quadrature constant, gives an angle of . The
hexagonal chord and the associated equilateral triangle will be a further crucial key element in this
hypothesis.
The pole at x=25/25 can therefore be unambiguously constructed starting from any inscribed hexagon
which, enforced by the primorial delta, projects at x=25/25 within this geometric framework.
