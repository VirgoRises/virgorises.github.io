That we arrived at the Archimedes spiral to model the volume of number might be labeled a “historic
mathematical coincidence” , being Archimedes discovering the principle cause of buoyancy let us hope
the hypothesis will float to the top. But this aside, the patterns of figure 7.22: Stack rhythm in the
plane, are drawn on a Cartesian plane representing volume. Table 8.1: Spectrum orthogonal diagonal
full cycle, lays out a two dimensional array that extends to 50 rows and columns of . The
 ensures that 50 iterations suffice to complete a full cycle, . The
variable  determines the value for which  data points represent intersecting radii.
The radius subdivides into units . The proportion  models the reduction in volume
as function of surface area.
Table 8.1, represents just one out of an infinite number of gradients that represent a 8-fold increase in
volume.

Interval, chaos and strange attractor
Projected as a  surface, enhanced with a gradient, the spectrum of the  possible
intersections per unique value tells a story that culminates with a primorial connection.
Figure 8.1: Spectrum core orthogonal diagonal, shows the spectrum for each of the 7 primes on the
orthogonal diagonal, the starting value 1, and the first composite in the sequence, 25. Where ever the
color is absent the angle is 0, progressively the gradient lightens until . The set for
q=1 is the baseline. The diagonal from lower right to upper left is the inverse of the orthogonal
diagonal, the figure is symmetric over . The division in 4 quadrants is presents in all spectra, the
least discernible in q=25. There is an evolution visible in Cartesian patterns and patterns of spherical
geometry. It seems that at the transition between q=23 and q=25 Descartes wins the fight. This is the
core set, A to D, eight transitions 
, at transition  we find the clearest intermediate pattern between Cartesian
and spherical features.
Spectrum chain links
In the total stack, see figure 7.17: Stacking the core, we find 7 values ,
that link between the . Those chain links are displayed in figure 8.2: Spectrum composite

The spectrum for q=25 is familiar, .
The next spectrum for q=49 looks similar to q=1 but is in fact rotated over , the diagonals are
flipped and the whole configuration remains symmetrical over . It is as if we shifted perspective
from above to underneath the plane. The sets for  are member of the sets
.
They project on 
The set for q=91 is from  or , set 41 is in fact the midfield
value for  in figure 7.17: Stacking the core.
In this we see that a loop occurs connecting two values  both along the spiral, and
orthogonal to the spiral, through the bulk. The same goes for 
, etc. Each represents an interval of 50 (8), which is significant as a function of volume,
causing specific (surface) coordinates to line up, see figure 5.6: Root 2 equilibrium, where chords
merge forming a polar triangle, proportionally reducing  to  as function of volume.

The midfields as shown, do not merely connect along the spiral, but share radii with the 9th 
further up the stack. The midfield clearly ends a sequence of eighth , but does so scale
independent, as chain link in a continuous flow. In principle the spiral represents a continuum, but
comes prefixed with a rational set of coordinates enforced by units. Those units emerge from integer
wavelength resonating in the repository of potential. Mathematics follows nature in the sense that
applying mathematics involves counting and manipulating units. Nature does not know math, it
necessarily organizes by simple resonance patterns. Figure 8.4: Midfield radial connections, shows
radial connections between midfields and start of other . All of those radial segments are of
length 50 (8) as they connect arcs of the Archimedes spiral.
Just like the QGF 2-gon chord, the radius of  appears as a linear segment from a previous
cycle. In an infinity of steps it completes a  cycle passing along the way all conceivable angles with
the x-axis, until the radius stretched to x=16 at which point the doubling of radius indicates a
completed cycle.
In the QGF representation, figure 7.2: Quadrature Geometric Framework, the chord at infinity stands
orthogonal to the x-axis after two triangular, or primorial cycles of . Here  is proportional to
.
There are intermediate values that seem to be missing. These missing values represent nodes
intersecting with diagonal  and do not appear on the spiral, which of course represents

The connection with 40 units, see section 7.- The forties, re-emerges by  . The model can be
projected on  which makes sense by a repetitive scale invariant projection of
. A sub sequential repetition will result arithmetically in , but in a physical
implementation taken from a view of scale invariance, the observer will just measure two cycles
. In section 5.- Unity orthogonal to the sphere, the statement made was: “The
question to ask is however, did you not notice your radius decreasing?”. This question implies that
somehow the physical universe is in a state of continuous collapse, and thus a further statement
keeps the energy flowing: “At which set of points does the energy of a blast project at any given point
in time?”
At the edge of chaos, the primorial
spectrum
Fractal recurrence in shape like the Mandelbrot set shows, does not cause motion, nor does it cause
“time” or can it be equated to “energy”. It is however observable, measurable and can be modeled to
produce beautiful images, preferably zoom-able on our computer screens. The beauty disappears
from the vantage of one particular point on some arbitrary line, nothing changes from the points
perspective because non of its neighbors changes.
25, primorial equilibrium
We are not in such a dire clueless state, but we are like such points nonetheless. If all changes in
relation with all other things, then at first glance no change occurs. Taking a closer look at figure 7.19:
Orthogonal fractal stack zeta, the set of diagonals  provide some answers that connect the
QGF intimately with the primorial function. In figure 8.5: The primorial stack, each prime on the fractal
core stack is amended with the quotient , and . The orthogonal diagonals
subdivide the primorial product in two distinct factors,  and

The pole at  and the subdivision in units of  is the foundation under the QGF, in the stack prime
5 and composite 25 indicate a connection. In the fractal core stack we find in  indications of a
winding path along a continuous curve that at each prime interval finds a cusp of . The “path along a
continuous curve” must be true, because the prime after 23 is 29 and yields
.
In stead the curve passes the composite  along the way, and 
, indicating a full cycle just occurred.
This occurrence of some random integer composite in this sequence of primes can only be meaningful
if the intermediate integer 24 has some profound reason not to appear on  as the first next integer
in line. Aside from the fact that division by 25 then would not yield an integer result, “24” would know
neither decide not to be there because of that fact, as would  etc, no numerical
consciousness present is the best guess. End of fun section.
It does have one reason that is not immediately obvious but can be derived from the location of prime
23. Composite 24 appears to belong sequentially to , above 23, but in fact it claims position at
, the 6th position of block number 4,  on diagonal , see fiigure 7.17: Stacking the
core.
This condition of pattern was postulated in eq. [eq:block-stamp] and the primorial stack nails down the
case for the fractal argument and might provide a pathway towards a closed formula for the number
and location of primes .
The spectrum for the primorials
The primorial function is a product of primes, see table 3.1: Primorial root 2 approach, column
, and those intermediate products have a spectrum, see figure 8.6:
Primorial spectrum. The sets for  are those residing on diagonal , all the following lay on
diagonal  and those show a nice consistency in discrete cycles.2.52 1

Primorial spectrum
However, from  on, all following  products are a factor of 10, and because the
prime factors are odd, only the 4 spectra will be generated that end in .
This does not take into account though, that these spectra, with exception of the first two, are the
products of two orthogonal diagonals.
Factors on the orthogonal diagonal
To obtain the spectra of the factors on the orthogonal diagonal we use a simple quotient. Each factor
on that diagonal is  which is a familiar pattern indicating proportionality with  by

surface zeta equilibrium.

Equilibrium at the bow shock
In “QGF in its natural configuration” there was mention of a “repository of potential” needed for
explaining the dynamic behavior we were about to invoke in describing dynamical behavior of the
physical implementation of the QGF.
At this point we only have a first principle that might account for the emergence of a quantum
harmonic oscillator in a complete convex set when the abstraction of the QGF is superimposed on that
set. How does one account for a repository of potential that, by observation and experimentation, has
real tactile properties, spatial and temporal qualities.
It is not sufficient to ‘declare’ such a space into existence and explain its properties in terms of
(analogies to) the QGF.
Wikipedia: Energy In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object
in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of
conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The
SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a
distance of 1 meter against a force of 1 newton.
Spatial qualities are in fact non existent. The QGF models a dimensionless point that can neither
expand nor collapse. But we observe both collapse and expansion at all conceivable scales, so how to
account for spatial displacement if, as proposed, there are no such things as spatial qualities in the
dimensionless point.
There is no mystery here, looking out into the universe is receiving signals from times long gone. The
M-brane mono surface stretches out in time, is in a excited state and is in a entropic process similar to
a dampened oscillator eventually coming to absolute rest.
Yes, “absolute” in clear defiance of the zero point energy attributed to Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty
principle. The notion of what energy exactly is has a clear explanation under this framework. It is the
nature of circumstances that led to the observation that energy evidently is conserved and must be
some eternal quantity that can not be destroyed. The repository of potential that we occupy is
structured such that observation must led to that conclusion.
Then what is it? The Planck constant represents the staccato transfer of potential from unity chord to
unity chord at some point of equilibrium as if part of a zone of constant pressure in a shock wave. A
continuous gradient of collapsing surface area.
It is at the front of a shock wave that we envision the conditions that at first sight energy, and by
extension information, is preserved.
The universe that we experience to be a spatial realm, expanding in time, is in fact an illusion of ever
decreasing ‘surface area’. This surface area that we are part of close to atomic scale, has a cross
section that stretches out from the Planck scale to the center of the great voids at universal scale. This
thin layer of activity is the M-brane mono surface coming to rest by shifting potential from layer to
layer, the absolute surface area of the bow shock reduces with the radius, and us observers are
integral part of that surface. It is space that apparently expands in relation to that for the observer
static surface area, but in fact is just an illusion caused by re-configuring potential.
Spatial qualities are an illusion of shifting potential traversing the zero dimensional point. This
equilibrium at the bow shock is our universe, a phase transition akin to a boiling kettle of water, a
constant  until there is nothing to evaporate left. At which point the bow shock ran its course,
Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle is no more and the potential called “time” reduced to nothing.

divisible quantity, but as a discrete quantity composed of an integral number of finite equal parts. Let
us call each such part the energy element -- Planck, On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal

The size of the mathematical universe
Our mathematical universe, given the 8 units on , has the definite size of .
Not every angle, line or pattern, no matter how appealing, has to have structural meaning in the
context of this thesis. Humans are pattern seeking animals by evolutionary necessity and find patterns
even where non exist.
 and  represent areas by triangular projection. In the limit of the triangular projection we
are left with a field of dimensionless points, a surface which only structure exists by the linear relation
of the natural numbers, a line for short.
In this context we are justified to interpret the sum of primes as a linear feature, one that exists on
two diagonals. As shown in figure 8.4: Midfield radial connections, there exist a configuration at which
those two diagonals line up, and in essence represent the diagonal  in figure 7.8: Pair
correlation proportional chord, at the point of equilibrium. In figure 6.3: M-brane mono surface radii
group III, line , the longest line in our universe is a diagonal of a square. All this we find
sufficient corroboration to postulate the size of our (mathematical) universe. But then again, “64” is not
that poetic standing there alongside “42”, no cult status just yet. So let us see what 64 has to offer,
maybe a slice of history is possible.
Taken the sum of primes as line , the we find , and this
provides us with a universal unit of area , this all is a bit nondescript until we
unlock some beautiful relation and take some time to ponder on the following.100°C
