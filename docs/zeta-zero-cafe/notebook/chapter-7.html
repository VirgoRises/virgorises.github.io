<p>That we arrived at the Archimedes spiral to model the volume of number might be labeled a “historic</p>
<p>mathematical coincidence” , being Archimedes discovering the principle cause of buoyancy let us hope</p>
<p>the hypothesis will float to the top. But this aside, the patterns of figure 7.22: Stack rhythm in the</p>

<p>Projected as a  surface, enhanced with a gradient, the spectrum of the  possible</p>
<p>intersections per unique value tells a story that culminates with a primorial connection.</p>
<p>Figure 8.1: Spectrum core orthogonal diagonal, shows the spectrum for each of the 7 primes on the</p>
<p>orthogonal diagonal, the starting value 1, and the first composite in the sequence, 25. Where ever the</p>
<p>color is absent the angle is 0, progressively the gradient lightens until . The set for</p>
<p>q=1 is the baseline. The diagonal from lower right to upper left is the inverse of the orthogonal</p>
<p>diagonal, the figure is symmetric over . The division in 4 quadrants is presents in all spectra, the</p>
<p>least discernible in q=25. There is an evolution visible in Cartesian patterns and patterns of spherical</p>
<p>geometry. It seems that at the transition between q=23 and q=25 Descartes wins the fight. This is the</p>
<p>core set, A to D, eight transitions </p>
<p>, at transition  we find the clearest intermediate pattern between Cartesian</p>
<p>and spherical features.</p>
<h2 id="sec-8">Spectrum chain links</h2>
<p>In the total stack, see figure 7.17: Stacking the core, we find 7 values ,</p>
<p>that link between the . Those chain links are displayed in figure 8.2: Spectrum composite</p>

<p>The spectrum for q=25 is familiar, .</p>
<p>The next spectrum for q=49 looks similar to q=1 but is in fact rotated over , the diagonals are</p>
<p>flipped and the whole configuration remains symmetrical over . It is as if we shifted perspective</p>
<p>from above to underneath the plane. The sets for  are member of the sets</p>

<p>The set for q=91 is from  or , set 41 is in fact the midfield</p>
<p>value for  in figure 7.17: Stacking the core.</p>
<p>In this we see that a loop occurs connecting two values  both along the spiral, and</p>
<p>orthogonal to the spiral, through the bulk. The same goes for </p>
<p>, etc. Each represents an interval of 50 (8), which is significant as a function of volume,</p>
<p>causing specific (surface) coordinates to line up, see figure 5.6: Root 2 equilibrium, where chords</p>
<p>merge forming a polar triangle, proportionally reducing  to  as function of volume.</p>

<p>The midfields as shown, do not merely connect along the spiral, but share radii with the 9th </p>
<p>further up the stack. The midfield clearly ends a sequence of eighth , but does so scale</p>
<p>independent, as chain link in a continuous flow. In principle the spiral represents a continuum, but</p>
<p>comes prefixed with a rational set of coordinates enforced by units. Those units emerge from integer</p>
<p>wavelength resonating in the repository of potential. Mathematics follows nature in the sense that</p>
<p>applying mathematics involves counting and manipulating units. Nature does not know math, it</p>
<p>necessarily organizes by simple resonance patterns. Figure 8.4: Midfield radial connections, shows</p>
<p>radial connections between midfields and start of other . All of those radial segments are of</p>
<p>length 50 (8) as they connect arcs of the Archimedes spiral.</p>
<p>Just like the QGF 2-gon chord, the radius of  appears as a linear segment from a previous</p>
<p>cycle. In an infinity of steps it completes a  cycle passing along the way all conceivable angles with</p>
<p>the x-axis, until the radius stretched to x=16 at which point the doubling of radius indicates a</p>
<p>completed cycle.</p>
<p>In the QGF representation, figure 7.2: Quadrature Geometric Framework, the chord at infinity stands</p>
<p>orthogonal to the x-axis after two triangular, or primorial cycles of . Here  is proportional to</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There are intermediate values that seem to be missing. These missing values represent nodes</p>
<p>intersecting with diagonal  and do not appear on the spiral, which of course represents</p>

<p>The connection with 40 units, see section 7.- The forties, re-emerges by  . The model can be</p>
<p>projected on  which makes sense by a repetitive scale invariant projection of</p>
<p>. A sub sequential repetition will result arithmetically in , but in a physical</p>
<p>implementation taken from a view of scale invariance, the observer will just measure two cycles</p>
<p>. In section 5.- Unity orthogonal to the sphere, the statement made was: “The</p>
<p>question to ask is however, did you not notice your radius decreasing?”. This question implies that</p>
<p>somehow the physical universe is in a state of continuous collapse, and thus a further statement</p>
<p>keeps the energy flowing: “At which set of points does the energy of a blast project at any given point</p>
<p>in time?”</p>
<p>At the edge of chaos, the primorial</p>
<p>spectrum</p>
<p>Fractal recurrence in shape like the Mandelbrot set shows, does not cause motion, nor does it cause</p>
<p>“time” or can it be equated to “energy”. It is however observable, measurable and can be modeled to</p>
<p>produce beautiful images, preferably zoom-able on our computer screens. The beauty disappears</p>
<p>from the vantage of one particular point on some arbitrary line, nothing changes from the points</p>
<p>perspective because non of its neighbors changes.</p>
<p>25, primorial equilibrium</p>
<p>We are not in such a dire clueless state, but we are like such points nonetheless. If all changes in</p>
<p>relation with all other things, then at first glance no change occurs. Taking a closer look at figure 7.19:</p>
<p>Orthogonal fractal stack zeta, the set of diagonals  provide some answers that connect the</p>
<p>QGF intimately with the primorial function. In figure 8.5: The primorial stack, each prime on the fractal</p>
<p>core stack is amended with the quotient , and . The orthogonal diagonals</p>

<p>The pole at  and the subdivision in units of  is the foundation under the QGF, in the stack prime</p>
<p>5 and composite 25 indicate a connection. In the fractal core stack we find in  indications of a</p>
<p>winding path along a continuous curve that at each prime interval finds a cusp of . The “path along a</p>
<p>continuous curve” must be true, because the prime after 23 is 29 and yields</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In stead the curve passes the composite  along the way, and </p>
<p>, indicating a full cycle just occurred.</p>
<p>This occurrence of some random integer composite in this sequence of primes can only be meaningful</p>
<p>if the intermediate integer 24 has some profound reason not to appear on  as the first next integer</p>
<p>in line. Aside from the fact that division by 25 then would not yield an integer result, “24” would know</p>
<p>neither decide not to be there because of that fact, as would  etc, no numerical</p>
<p>consciousness present is the best guess. End of fun section.</p>
<p>It does have one reason that is not immediately obvious but can be derived from the location of prime</p>
<p>23. Composite 24 appears to belong sequentially to , above 23, but in fact it claims position at</p>
<p>, the 6th position of block number 4,  on diagonal , see fiigure 7.17: Stacking the</p>
<p>core.</p>
<p>This condition of pattern was postulated in eq. [eq:block-stamp] and the primorial stack nails down the</p>
<p>case for the fractal argument and might provide a pathway towards a closed formula for the number</p>
<p>and location of primes .</p>
<h2 id="sec-9">The spectrum for the primorials</h2>
<p>The primorial function is a product of primes, see table 3.1: Primorial root 2 approach, column</p>
<p>, and those intermediate products have a spectrum, see figure 8.6:</p>
<p>Primorial spectrum. The sets for  are those residing on diagonal , all the following lay on</p>

<p>However, from  on, all following  products are a factor of 10, and because the</p>
<p>prime factors are odd, only the 4 spectra will be generated that end in .</p>
<p>This does not take into account though, that these spectra, with exception of the first two, are the</p>
<p>products of two orthogonal diagonals.</p>
<p>Factors on the orthogonal diagonal</p>
<p>To obtain the spectra of the factors on the orthogonal diagonal we use a simple quotient. Each factor</p>

<p>Equilibrium at the bow shock</p>
<p>In “QGF in its natural configuration” there was mention of a “repository of potential” needed for</p>
<p>explaining the dynamic behavior we were about to invoke in describing dynamical behavior of the</p>
<p>physical implementation of the QGF.</p>
<p>At this point we only have a first principle that might account for the emergence of a quantum</p>
<p>harmonic oscillator in a complete convex set when the abstraction of the QGF is superimposed on that</p>
<p>set. How does one account for a repository of potential that, by observation and experimentation, has</p>
<p>real tactile properties, spatial and temporal qualities.</p>
<p>It is not sufficient to ‘declare’ such a space into existence and explain its properties in terms of</p>
<p>(analogies to) the QGF.</p>
<p>Wikipedia: Energy In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object</p>
<p>in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of</p>
<p>conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The</p>
<p>SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a</p>
<p>distance of 1 meter against a force of 1 newton.</p>
<p>Spatial qualities are in fact non existent. The QGF models a dimensionless point that can neither</p>
<p>expand nor collapse. But we observe both collapse and expansion at all conceivable scales, so how to</p>
<p>account for spatial displacement if, as proposed, there are no such things as spatial qualities in the</p>
<p>dimensionless point.</p>
<p>There is no mystery here, looking out into the universe is receiving signals from times long gone. The</p>
<p>M-brane mono surface stretches out in time, is in a excited state and is in a entropic process similar to</p>
<p>a dampened oscillator eventually coming to absolute rest.</p>
<p>Yes, “absolute” in clear defiance of the zero point energy attributed to Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty</p>
<p>principle. The notion of what energy exactly is has a clear explanation under this framework. It is the</p>
<p>nature of circumstances that led to the observation that energy evidently is conserved and must be</p>
<p>some eternal quantity that can not be destroyed. The repository of potential that we occupy is</p>
<p>structured such that observation must led to that conclusion.</p>
<p>Then what is it? The Planck constant represents the staccato transfer of potential from unity chord to</p>
<p>unity chord at some point of equilibrium as if part of a zone of constant pressure in a shock wave. A</p>
<p>continuous gradient of collapsing surface area.</p>
<p>It is at the front of a shock wave that we envision the conditions that at first sight energy, and by</p>
<p>extension information, is preserved.</p>
<p>The universe that we experience to be a spatial realm, expanding in time, is in fact an illusion of ever</p>
<p>decreasing ‘surface area’. This surface area that we are part of close to atomic scale, has a cross</p>
<p>section that stretches out from the Planck scale to the center of the great voids at universal scale. This</p>
<p>thin layer of activity is the M-brane mono surface coming to rest by shifting potential from layer to</p>
<p>layer, the absolute surface area of the bow shock reduces with the radius, and us observers are</p>
<p>integral part of that surface. It is space that apparently expands in relation to that for the observer</p>
<p>static surface area, but in fact is just an illusion caused by re-configuring potential.</p>
<p>Spatial qualities are an illusion of shifting potential traversing the zero dimensional point. This</p>
<p>equilibrium at the bow shock is our universe, a phase transition akin to a boiling kettle of water, a</p>
<p>constant  until there is nothing to evaporate left. At which point the bow shock ran its course,</p>
<p>Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle is no more and the potential called “time” reduced to nothing.</p>
<p>Wikipedia: to interpret UN (the vibrational energy of N oscillators) not as a continuous, infinitely</p>
<p>divisible quantity, but as a discrete quantity composed of an integral number of finite equal parts. Let</p>
<p>us call each such part the energy element -- Planck, On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal</p>
<p>Spectrum</p>
<p>The size of the mathematical universe</p>
<p>Our mathematical universe, given the 8 units on , has the definite size of .</p>
<p>Not every angle, line or pattern, no matter how appealing, has to have structural meaning in the</p>
<p>context of this thesis. Humans are pattern seeking animals by evolutionary necessity and find patterns</p>
<p>even where non exist.</p>
<p> and  represent areas by triangular projection. In the limit of the triangular projection we</p>
<p>are left with a field of dimensionless points, a surface which only structure exists by the linear relation</p>
<p>of the natural numbers, a line for short.</p>
<p>In this context we are justified to interpret the sum of primes as a linear feature, one that exists on</p>
<p>two diagonals. As shown in figure 8.4: Midfield radial connections, there exist a configuration at which</p>
<p>those two diagonals line up, and in essence represent the diagonal  in figure 7.8: Pair</p>
<p>correlation proportional chord, at the point of equilibrium. In figure 6.3: M-brane mono surface radii</p>
<p>group III, line , the longest line in our universe is a diagonal of a square. All this we find</p>
<p>sufficient corroboration to postulate the size of our (mathematical) universe. But then again, “64” is not</p>
<p>that poetic standing there alongside “42”, no cult status just yet. So let us see what 64 has to offer,</p>
<p>maybe a slice of history is possible.</p>
<p>Taken the sum of primes as line , the we find , and this</p>
<p>provides us with a universal unit of area , this all is a bit nondescript until we</p>
<p>unlock some beautiful relation and take some time to ponder on the following.100°C</p>
