The QGF is based on the properties of a complete convex set, complete because no points exist
outside the set, the set is the complete universe.
Convex set From Wikipedia If the line segment joining any pair of arbitrary
points (x,y) lie completely within the set boundary, the set is convex. Since
the red part of the (black and red) line-segment joining the points x and y
lies outside of the set, the set is non-convex.
The ‘Quadrature Geometric Framework’ is a model for a ‘first principle’, an ‘ab initio’ condition that
underpins behavior of units in both mathematics (numbers), as physics (wave/particles) and be shown
to emerge independently with the physical realm.
Primorial hexagon plus
The basis for the QGF is derived from the primorial hexagon, figure 3.4: Primorial hexagon. The QGF
(figure 7.2 quadrature geometric framework has a pole at  and at , see the
zoomed in section on the lower right.= 2.52 2π
↬2π= ×↬ 2.52
This dual notation is by design, for all intents and purposes these coordinates  are to be
considered one and the same and only separated by arbitrary choice of perspective.
The illustration shows chords within the bounds of the pole  and chords stretching out
beyond the pole, also indicated is a chord at infinity orthogonal to the x-axis. The chords belong to n-
gon that have two identities.
Scale invariant. The scale invariant coordinates for the n-gon are simply the x-coordinate x=n
for he circumscribed circle, this is the identity from which the chord length is calculated.
Absolute. Because the pole at , all n have a absolute coordinate relative to the
(chosen) pole. The absolute coordinate for a n-gon is , e.g.
One ring to enclose them all
Each arbitrary x-coordinate can be designated as pole, that x coordinate becomes the unit and spawns
its unique set of n-gons. This is done by selecting a  and if needed change perspective by
, using a  with sufficient decimal expansion.
Mathematically both the region drawn inside the pole as well the region extending beyond lay within
the convex set. It is the pole at  that represents the boundary of the infinite plane of the
QGF, not the boundary that divides . e.g.
 spans the pole seamlessly.
In physical systems, however, this pole represents the ‘boundary’ of the universe, the point at infinity
as you will. The region that geometrically projects beyond  to infinity, will in physical
projection overlay the area .
The pole at  can be understood to behave in physical sense as end of a medium and a
(maximum elastic) reflector.

Chords, almost created equal
The scale invariant coordinates for the n-gon are simply the x-coordinate x=n for the circumscribed
circle. From this the length of the chords can be easily calculated by .
The unit chord from which all others are measured (table 7.1 QGF standard chord and deviation) is the
chord for . In table 4.1:Discrete triangular - Continues
projection plane, , associated with , marks chord 
in Figure 5.2: Planck base - Unity chord. This matches with table 7.1 QGF standard chord and deviation 
 because . By this the absolute value
 reflects the scale invariant  proportional to any
hexagon. The obvious difference is that  is the hypotenuse and  a right angle side. The
interchange of sides b and c is one aspect, the fact that  means that although
 is a proportion that can occur, but not if b is approached as the absolute value
, e.g. the circumference of a circle with radius  is , the
circumference of a circle with radius  is proportionally , but in absolute terms . As is with
 if for a right angled triangle 
Where does the unity chord live
The right angled sides associated with a unity chord are derived from the chord (hypotenuse) by
 and . From b derive the value a for the associated  projection.

Pinpoint n in the triangular cycle (inverse triangular formula).
Contrast with the enclosing  for integer n=9 and n=10.
The ratio is the same as encountered in figure 6.6: M-brane mono surface detail 9 over 60, where for
each cycle the affected area is divided in  and  , a function ofar ea
dependent on the angle and “calibrated” to exact . The interpretation is that in physical systems this
margin translates to apparent spatial aspects, but abstract geometry can not, does not enforce spatial
aspects, a method for independent emergent behavior that underlays the QGF must exist.
The primorial connection
The ratio is related to the primorial function by the following observation:
The primorial oscillation, table 3.2: Primorial lb/ub oscillation, column  gives
Application of the quadrature constant gives a lower and upper bound for the occurrence of Planck&#x27;s

The forties
Because the total cycle over the quadrant stretches  must be the unit increment
per cycle, . Each  period represented by , projects on a  plane and
represents the traversed angle  as function of area. The angle progresses in steps of 
or  dependent on chosen projection . In
short, the decimal system emerges from the sexagesimal expanding/decreasing area as it takes 10
incremental periods to complete 60 parts. Note that these 10 periods are grouped in 2 cycles of
.
Powers of ten to infinity
In table 5.1: Hexagonal equilibrium, the column  indicates that
 occurs in the span of .
This translates to a span of  in which 2 cycles of  each account
for , a tenfold increase of the chord  over the span of the triangular projection,
see table 4.1: Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane, and figure 5.2:Planck base - Unity chord,
and likewise the primorial root 2 approach ,
By some measure, the chords expand or decrease in size with a factor 10 and everything apparently
blows up. But there is a solution that at its core has dark energy and zeta zero&#x27;s intimately entangled
in a numerical expansion that will make perfect sense. But first why chords do not resize absolutely,
only relatively.
In the QGF configuration the length of the chords of each n-gon is  and approaches a
length of , . This limit to the chord length is the key that allows us to define a
physical model from which the QGF as first principle emerges and by this the foundation under the
otherwise unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in modeling the observed universe and its
physical interactions.
The natural state as repository of
potential
The n-chords in the QGF have their own “orbits” at the geometric radius 
(relative to the pole at ). All QGF chords are periodic chords, but will only be revealed as such when
expressed by a modulated repository of potential. In the physical implementation of the QGF the pole
at  is absolute, it represents the outer limit of a complete convex set.
In figure 7.3: QGF natural state, the horizontal shaded bar encloses a vertical range,
 and stretches over the range . The lower end is
 because the chord at  is in fact the  orthogonal chord at infinity
projected as a hexagonal chord under . Herein we find the two configurations responsible for the
 vs  as mentioned under subsection 7 - Powers of ten to infinity. The whole range between the
pole and infinity gets confined to the maximum radius  and the accumulated sum translates,
because orthogonal, to .90°→ × =3

At coordinate x=1, the circle has a circumference of . This is to be considered the chord at
infinity as shown on the right of the picture at . The chord at infinity is the evolution of the
circle at x=1. The remaining chords at  progressively project at a steeper angle until at the
limit,  all chords stack up to an infinite line orthogonal to the x-axis, a circle of sorts,
just like the circle at coordinate 1 is a line of sorts.
A box of chords
Figure 7.3 shows that all chords fit the box, the maximum length is . The
number of chords contained in the box is , or a triangular infinity of
them, 
In figure 7.3 the shaded area between the 6-gon chord at x=6 and the  at  is
the range of the , labeled the harmonic range  because that shaded area
only holds , the first chord of each n-gon.
Each coordinate in the range  is a radius for a hexagon with radius x and chord size x. In
figure 7.3 the x-coordinate is normalized to  which is the
range for column , table 7.1: QGF standard chord and deviation, for  to .
The question is how to confine the infinite set of chords to , and more pressing (no pun intended),
how to fit for example a 10-gon in a 6-gon box.c=2π

Compression is the answer to surplus chords , in table 7.2:Chord length and relative density, the
column n starts at n=6. In their geometric identity all chords for n&lt;7 can be inscribed n times at x=n.
The chords for n&gt;6 that are part of the same set do not fit any other x-coordinate because the QGF
framework is designed this way, absolute position, absolute size, each chord represents a unique
coordinate.
The column  in table 7.2: Chord length and relative density, lists the calculated length of the chords
at their designated geometric x coordinate, starting with  and thereafter the chords get
progressively larger.
T7.02@ osf (y2hxc)
Table 7.02 Chord length and relative density
The chord at  is exactly  and allows for a hexagon with radius  to fit inside the pole.
This means that each  fits the  as hexagon at coordinate . The column  lists the
normalized  and column  lists how many such chords are available for coordinate . Column
“surplus” shows the amount of chords the local hexagon does not allow for if not expressed as
density/compression factor .
Each chord is part of a hexagon representing a snare compressed into to n-6 integer parts that define
the harmonic to which the snare is tuned. In fact there are n radii that define a circumference
behaving like a “particle in a box” configuration. Figure 7.5 Particle in a box and Harmonic oscillator,

The n-chords n&gt;6 exist on their own unique radius between x=6 and . For each radius the
resulting chord length is unique, .
The first possible fit is a hexagon, the radius defines the chord length and hence the compression
factor. This sets up a stack of hexagons that in the surplus chords mimic the configuration of a
quantum harmonic oscillator with energy level . The layers are tuned to the integer surplus for
each hexagon, see table 7.2: Chord length and relative density, but that integer surplus defines n-
chords that are unique real values .
E.g. The 7-chord projects geometrically beyond . The 7-chord has a length of
, that is, all 7 chords of them, but only 6 chords will fit the
circumference at , the remaining chord (wave) can be envisioned as bouncing
between the walls forming a standing wave, see figure 7.5 particle-in-a-box, first level.
The largest n-gon in the QGF that fits the circumference is the 6-gon, this is the lowest energy state
equivalent in a physical setting, fits snug without surplus to bounce around. Given a repository of
potential with a infinitely hard rigid border, the ultimate particle in a box example must be the
universe itself.
Prime interference
The surplus as listed in table 7.2: Chord length and relative density, is at first glance represented by
the set of Natural numbers , but column  tells a different story. In fact it is not even a triangular
number set because each diagonal has n copies of column , as it should because the diagonals
represent all the chords of the associated n-gon.
Using the analogy of a De Broglie wave we can envision each diagonal to represent a string of specific
density “surplus”. Like tuning a snare on an instrument the “surplus” can be envisioned as a measure
of tension on the string. Note that in abstract geometric sense there is no such thing as a , all n-
gons occupy there natural coordinate, “fit snugly” and have no “surplus” chords. The relative density is
given by the quotient  and of vital importance. Unlike  the surplus consists of values
that are not unit values but are more prime-like. It is as if putting the primes in one to one
correspondence with the natural numbers, but not by assigning a number, in stead grouping those
primes in n copies, as in matrix 7.13.x=2π

This does not seem very useful, but matrix 7.12 is in fact analogues to this arrangement. The set of
chords within a n-gon are equivalent but differ from all other chords in the QGF. The hexagonal
structure splits those n-chords per diagonal over 6 chords and gives the relative density  for each
diagonal, forming a string with a specific density. This specific density in physical sense is of vital
importance, the resonance frequencies of such ‘strings’ can be equated to the set of prime numbers
among the Natural numbers , each chord acts like a snare uniquely tuned for the n-gon. The
comparison with prime numbers is a valid one, be it that every hexagon consists of 6 chords of that
specific density. Naively one could make the comparison that electrons, all possessing the same set of
properties could be modeled by a n-gon of the size n-electrons in the universe. The QGF is broader
than representing one singular set, a less naive representation is forthcoming. All being well, but can
the assumption of a repository of potential structured like the QGF be verified in natural systems.
Observations
This specific density is probably linked to observed features like present in hexagonal basalt, the
fracture pattern of gradually dried mud planes or for instance the hexagonal features at the north
pole of Saturn. A volatile environment comes slowly to rest and at certain point the system organizes
into an equilibrium. Mud flats dry out faster than a few 1000 of basalt cools down, the hexagonal
structure is more obvious in columnar basalt than in the crack pattern of a mud plane. The specific
pattern at Saturn&#x27;s north pole exists in a rather volatile atmosphere as the pattern is thought to be
caused by jet streams and can be modeled to appear in simulations of atmospheric conditions. The
more granular the subset, the less obvious the hexagonal equilibrium. Recognizing any odd pattern is
part of being human, so we need a process to connect the dots. Geometrically we can appreciate
numerical indicators that might be labeled as “density” , but a label does not cause behavior.
Geometric, density dependent primes
No such thing as abstract density, but in a physical system any variation in density can cause “strings”
to match density with adjacent “strings” (hexagons) in the  lattice. A propagating wave on one n-
gon can reroute, either temporarily or periodically during density fluctuations. This dynamic enables
strings that in the base state differ in density to transfer potential, to and fro, notably quantified in
character. Of course for something to fluctuate it needs to exist. Particle accelerators collide blobs of
energy, those do exist, scientist wack those blobs and study the way the energy dissipates. But what
do those “blobs” consist off is the question we hope to answer. The link between the abstraction of
chords and physics can be made via the pair correlation function.
Pair correlation
In 1972 at the Institute of Advanced Study Freeman Dyson and Hugh Montgomery compared notes.
Hugh Montgomery found that  is the theoretical prediction for two-point correlations
in the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. According to Freeman Dyson⎡

Figure 7.7: Geometric Primes and Pair correlation, shows three series. The upper series simply plots
the relative density  from the normalized chord length . This is an
absolute value which in the physical implementation of the QGF is the x-coordinate of the  hexagon
shaping ‘the box’ that the n-chords project, and compress, into.

Planck&#x27;s constant as discrepancy in surface area seems significant, we found for the fractal argument
for zeta (section 4 - The fractal argument for zeta)  as the equilibrium for volume and
surface area, a value  for the hexagonal chords and here a rather precise value without
using a fudge factor.
Looking back from infinity
In figure 7.8: pair correlation proportional chord, the second quadrant on the left shows some sample
angles and the square of the sine function J to M. The right side shows two of those, 
and . The square of the sine function for M and K shows the equilibrium in the shared
diagonal . This is equivalent to
Pair correlation as function of volume
The Montgomery/Dyson pair-correlation formula  and the geometric primes are in
intimate relation (see Figure 7.7: Geometric Primes and Pair correlation). How intimate becomes clear
if we observe the following:
We are right back at volume over zeta, equation 2.3: volume over zeta, but now on the other side of a

Zeta zero to proportional QGF chord
To bring the zeta zeros into the range  one can simply apply . Figure 7.9: zeta
zeros normalized to pole range, shows the oscillatory character of the normalized values. This
characteristic oscillation is recognizable in the logarithmic integral function  summing over
the non trivial zeros. We need not go there, we will make sense of the zeta zeros in terms of the QGF.
If the non trivial zeros from complex analysis can be localized in the QGF schema, then the modulus
 is the prime candidate (maybe pun intended). Table 7.3: non trivial zero to unity
chord, lists the first 25 zeta zeros, up to 8 decimals will suffice for constructing the model, but it will
become clear that the decimal expansion can not be ignored as the sample set increases.

There are two sets of columns, “Complex” shows the real, imaginary and the derived modulus in their
familiar form, set “ Hexagonal unity chords” is where the complex modulus is normalized. The
normalization assumes the zeta zeros to represent  values en reduces them to  by taking the
fourth root of the modulus,  and then normalize this to  by . The list
makes no use of any sorting, the zeta zeros are listed in order of appearance and as such match the
structure of the QGF. The zeta zeros  do not represent individual
 from the set of natural numbers but are sets of n-zeros for each  as represented in
matrix 7.12 chord diagonal matrix, and 7.13 chord diagonal matrix prime. In table 7.2: Chord length

surface area encoded in the zeta zeros. The area inside the QGF pole is represented by the 21 zeta
zeros in level 1 and therefor all chords that project inside the pole for every scale invariant natural
state of the QGF are represented.
Interlaced zeta and repulsion
Each of the levels has a fixed number of zeros and a fixed range in which the zeros project, this is
illustrated in figure 7.11: Interlaced zeta zero.
It is in the projection of level 1,  that the
characteristic level repulsion pattern of spacing between zeta zeros begins to show.
The progression of the levels as seen in figure 7.11 shows that the lower range becomes progressively
denser. Level 2  only starts intruding into
Level 1 at  as it projects past .
Naturally in pieces
All the natural numbers are interlaced in parts. For every  there are  representing that
number that diffusely interlace on the real axis. The number of zeta zeros is an area
 and each zero is an area the size of , e.g. to represent the number n=7, 7
uniquely sized  project on the real axis, not as a continuous string of zeros, but spread out as dots
on a rubber sheet, like galaxies spreading with the expansion of space. As shown in figure
7.12:Interlaced zeta zero detail, this is not a loosely formulated analogy, it is a quite accurate
description of the process involved. The figure shows the geometric spreading of zeta zeros where the
first zero on the left of level 1 is from number . The eight squares on
level 2, making up the range for number  to 
enclose also one of two zeros for number  but not .

In fact there are more numbers interlaced in the range for . From the first 950 zeta zeros (up
to 9 decimal places suffices in this region), 134 zeros spread over the first 4 levels are included in the

All between  to , see the diagonal indicated by  in matrix [eq:n-in-pieces].
This does not mean that the distribution is solved by the depiction of levels in matrix [eq:n-in-pieces]
because as seen  wedges between  and the second zero of
 does not. The diagonals must depict a unique sequence of area that can be equated to
a natural number, but as seen that area gets stretched out, fragmented beyond recognition. But
seemingly not ad infinitum so, it is like a shifting panel of affected area (figure 7.11: Interlaced zeta
zero). What happens is that when a larger range is selected, observed granularity increases
proportionally. In fact we know of such a property occurring in the physical realm and we alluded to it
before, it is the expansion of space itself. It seems that with the expansion of space the energy content
does not get diluted, local conditions remain stable while space expands into oblivion.
What is proposed here is not to interpret the measured effect as “expansion of space”, but as artifact
of observing space from a regressing surface area. One that continuously decreases its radial distance
to the singularity at the center, but expressed as a phase shift that enforces local parameters to
maintain stability. e.g. similar to the constant temperature at the melting point of water ice, or boiling
point of water. Selecting a greater subset by application of some arbitrary coordinate system increases
local granularity relative to that coordinate system. This intuition seems confirmed by figures 7.11 and
7.12, as it is clear that the levels condense ever increasing sets of zeta zeros in proportionally
compacter stretches of the real line (y-axis), see figures 7.13: decent for zeta n, and 7.14: descent for
levels. From a perspective of scale in variance each level must in some sense be the fractal sibling of
the previous level. This implies that the stable configuration, section 7 - Stable QGF configuration,
holds the complete set of prime numbers, and all other primes are in some sense ghostS of
future levels.n=8■

Not “ghosts” in the sense of figments of the imagination, we can all count and apply the sieve of
Eratosthenes, but like a mirage projects a distant image in the dessert. There is something projected
that definitely does exist, only not there were its images appears to be. Figure 7.14: descent for levels,
implies that all cycles lay within the previous cycles, where figure 7.11; interlaced zeta zeros, provides
kind of a mirage where each level seems to project some distinct part of the continuum. It is a bit
counter intuitive but the things being stuffed are not numbers, what is stuffed are markers of spaces
between numbers, as if becomes apparent that those spaces are conglomerates of a finer grained
subset. What seems to be the case is that prime numbers are in some sense coordinates on the M-
brane mono-surface from where the horizon encloses rational fractions of the available space. It
seems that prime numbers are defined by being rational multiples of zeta zeros, and not just rational
multiples, but groups of multiples in specific order that exactly match some set of units shaping some
exact curvature of (prime) unit surface area. The conclusion must be that although  are seen as
the sum of equal partitions,  each 1 of them is one of a kind and has a specific size
(area / curvature). E.g.  Those spaces together are
responsible for the expanding surface area, filling the diagonal of the triangular plane
 level by level, each level unique in number and spread of zeta zeros.
Prime like distribution for all n
This of course means that the zeta zeros by themselves say nothing special about the distribution of
primes. Each level spreads the represented natural numbers out over that level in n parts. E.g
 zeros. The cumulative effect is the apparent accretion of surface
area as found in the projection plane model. The zeta zeros by their triangular distribution represent
an area , the area fills up over the diagonal as
 see matrix 7.16: n in pieces. Returning to the
triangular plane and its diagonal , at the end only  remains but yes, the zeta
zeros all line up on that diagonal, because in the triangular projection all of them lay on the diagonal of
the triangular plane. In the limit the whole  of them, any natural number, prime or not. QED for then∈N

Riemann hypothesis, at least for as far as the QGF goes. It is a bit frustrating to look at this picture and
realize that the nth (prime) number is distributed over that area in n parts, infinitely diffuse in spread,
how many time one wonders “where the (expletive) does that number live”. The geometric primes as
n-gon are as prime as it gets. But how to make the connection between prime numbers having a
specific location in , the distinct x coordinate for the geometric primes and the, ever shifting,
distribution of the zeta zeros. One answer is that the zeta zeros are even more prime than the
geometric primes, literally so because  e.g.
, 3 zeros each representing a unique chord as we are about to see.
Zetas walk about on the diagonal
The QGF chords resemble geometric primes in abstract sense, none divides the other, each can be
seen as a uniquely tuned string. The zeta zeros however do something different in the sense that they
clearly define a n-gon that is not regular, but has ever increasing chord length defined by consecutive
zeta zeros. Unlike the geometric chords that describe those of a hexagon, the chords represented by
the zeta zeros have a slightly higher value for each converted zero. The zeros are grouped according to
the triangular schema, but each zeta zero produces a unique chord length. Because of this unique
chord length the zeta zeros cannot form a regular n-gon. We know however by the triangular order
that they are n-gon like. One interpretation is that the deflection of the angles is as expected for an n-
gon , and thus the discrepancy in size must be due to “departing the circumscribed arc at 
” under condition of a actively shrinking radius and “landing on the circumscribed arc at  ” . This is
what is modeled in figure 7.15: Zeta zeros walk about.
The zeta zeros follow some intermediate path that seem to describe chords of a spiral that for each
set add up to 360 degrees, see matrix 7.17: zeta angle progression.
The construction of figure 7.15: zeta zeros walk about, is straight forward. Project the x-value, rotate
anti clockwise over the associated accumulative angle and connect to the end of the previous chord.
The interval between  progressing on the x-axis follow the harmonic series if the interval is defined
to full  periods,  The  along the x-axis follow the triangularN

Prime stretching in the projection plane
There are in total 30 primes involved in the mechanics of the projection plane model, see figure 7.16:
prime number triangular core set.
The prime number ‘5’ takes a pivotal role and presents itself in eighth identities, one in its original role
as the prime number 5, and then consecutive as the multiples
Also we see 5 extra identities for prime 7, of which  is just the same as ,
further  complete the range of composites for this section.
The prime distribution for the triangular plane starts with the stacking of the familiar triangular plane
 occupied cells along the orthogonal diagonal, see figure 7.17: Stacking the core.nCunity

For the configuration inside the pole 4 such  blocks affected area, labeled A to D are stacked
along the diagonal. The total affected area . Each  shows a upper
right value that is there as chain link to the left lower cell of the following block, indicating the chain
along the diagonal. Thus a diagonal of 7 primes plus the initial lower left 1 is formed summing up to
. The total of primes in this  configuration
sum op to 100 (excluding the lower left 1), including primes 2 and 3 not on the orthogonal diagonal.
This gives a  ratio that we register as the primorial delta . The pattern follows figure 4.9:
Projection plane regression, in its stacking of affected area,
and causes the primes  to line up along the diagonal. In the next image,
figure 7.18: Orthogonal succession, on the left the ordening of the zeta zeros is superimposed on the
triangular plane. On the right we find numerically a bad fit for the stack of primes to the zeta zero
indices, however, the affected area did not change, merely a swapping of square units occurred .
The zeta zeros are projected in their ‘natural’ n-gon position. The columns are numbered according to
the n-gon diagonals and therefor map the zeta groups to individual natural numbers. The prime
numbers in the index row below (shaded yellow) do not line up to the superimposed stack of primes.
The index row is there to indicate the zeta groupings and have no direct relation to the stack of
primes. We find the relation in the fractal argument for zeta, see section 4.-The fractal argument for
zeta. The fractal stack , see figure 4.10: Fractal stack, does project the zeros conform figure 7.17:
stacking the core, and as such matches the indices of specific zeta zero to either a prime number or
composite without obvious relation to the associated n-gon. e.g.

expansion of the  grid by a factor . Equation 5.3 in relation to the hexagonal
equilibrium indicates how the golden ratio appears in the root of curvature, and the curvature along
lines of sight postulated in section 6.- Necessarily convex.
The consequence of the stacking is a numerical additive sequence visiting primes and composites on
the diagonal , indicated are
the composites  and how they break down.
The initial  structure is replicated with each iteration, giving the pattern of
(combinations of) numbers each cell can hold.
All  are represented in the stack therefore the clear areas in figure 7.19: Orthogonal fractal stack
zeta are either compressed into the diagonal stack, or irrelevant.
The size of the plane
The diagonal sets the size of the triangular plane at , this gives us a measure for
the size of the diagonal , there is however another measure that we can
follow. The sum of the values on the diagonal is  or , the proportional area of a square6×6 =PΔ×1.664

The sectors are delimited by the 9 primes, labeled .
The circumference is subdivided in units of arc , derived from the spread of

The minimum increment , and  indicates there are 10
radii available for any distinct arithmetic sequence  to project on. This aspect causes a
skeletal structure of five radii ( stretched to ) where multiples of 5 land on. The radial distance
between each projection is forced by , it takes 50 steps on the x-axis to project a full
 further, this makes the radial distance a consistent  and the spiral Archimedean.
Figure 7.21: Projecting the stack, plots the complete stack A to T , see figure 7.17: Stacking the core, as
continuous succession of . In bold face, indicated by the black diamond,
the composites  project on 5 radii at  interval. All values on the x-
axis with an interval of 50 units project on the same radial, e.g.

.
Figure 7.22: Stack rhythm in the plane, shows the effect of plotting this sequence  on a 2-
dimensional plane. When p=5 we find that all intersections represent integer angles and that each fifth
value is either  or . With n=10 the same applies but consequently each
fifth iteration projects at .
Application of any other value preserves an integer angle for the fifth iteration because it will contain
some factor of prime 5. The pattern for sums of five do not simply repeat. As seen in figure 7.22: Stack
rhythm in the plane, the values 5, 10, 25 and 50 generate distinct patterns. These patterns are the
analogue of strange attractors in the QGF, the intermediate values vary considerably.= 360=7.2 Uarc1
