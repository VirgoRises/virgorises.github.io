<p>The QGF is based on the properties of a complete convex set, complete because no points exist</p>

<p>Convex set From Wikipedia If the line segment joining any pair of arbitrary</p>
<p>points (x,y) lie completely within the set boundary, the set is convex. Since</p>
<p>the red part of the (black and red) line-segment joining the points x and y</p>
<p>lies outside of the set, the set is non-convex.</p>
<p>The ‘Quadrature Geometric Framework’ is a model for a ‘first principle’, an ‘ab initio’ condition that</p>
<p>underpins behavior of units in both mathematics (numbers), as physics (wave/particles) and be shown</p>
<p>to emerge independently with the physical realm.</p>
<h2 id="sec-7">Primorial hexagon plus</h2>
<p>The basis for the QGF is derived from the primorial hexagon, figure 3.4: Primorial hexagon. The QGF</p>
<p>(figure 7.2 quadrature geometric framework has a pole at  and at , see the</p>
<p>zoomed in section on the lower right.= 2.52 2π</p>
<p>↬2π= ×↬ 2.52</p>
<p>This dual notation is by design, for all intents and purposes these coordinates  are to be</p>
<p>considered one and the same and only separated by arbitrary choice of perspective.</p>
<p>The illustration shows chords within the bounds of the pole  and chords stretching out</p>
<p>beyond the pole, also indicated is a chord at infinity orthogonal to the x-axis. The chords belong to n-</p>
<p>gon that have two identities.</p>
<p>Scale invariant. The scale invariant coordinates for the n-gon are simply the x-coordinate x=n</p>
<p>for he circumscribed circle, this is the identity from which the chord length is calculated.</p>
<p>Absolute. Because the pole at , all n have a absolute coordinate relative to the</p>
<p>(chosen) pole. The absolute coordinate for a n-gon is , e.g.</p>
<h2 id="sec-8">One ring to enclose them all</h2>
<p>Each arbitrary x-coordinate can be designated as pole, that x coordinate becomes the unit and spawns</p>
<p>its unique set of n-gons. This is done by selecting a  and if needed change perspective by</p>
<p>, using a  with sufficient decimal expansion.</p>
<p>Mathematically both the region drawn inside the pole as well the region extending beyond lay within</p>
<p>the convex set. It is the pole at  that represents the boundary of the infinite plane of the</p>
<p>QGF, not the boundary that divides . e.g.</p>
<p> spans the pole seamlessly.</p>
<p>In physical systems, however, this pole represents the ‘boundary’ of the universe, the point at infinity</p>
<p>as you will. The region that geometrically projects beyond  to infinity, will in physical</p>
<p>projection overlay the area .</p>
<p>The pole at  can be understood to behave in physical sense as end of a medium and a</p>
<p>(maximum elastic) reflector.</p>

<p>Chords, almost created equal</p>
<p>The scale invariant coordinates for the n-gon are simply the x-coordinate x=n for the circumscribed</p>
<p>circle. From this the length of the chords can be easily calculated by .</p>
<p>The unit chord from which all others are measured (table 7.1 QGF standard chord and deviation) is the</p>
<p>chord for . In table 4.1:Discrete triangular - Continues</p>
<p>projection plane, , associated with , marks chord </p>
<p>in Figure 5.2: Planck base - Unity chord. This matches with table 7.1 QGF standard chord and deviation </p>
<p> because . By this the absolute value</p>
<p> reflects the scale invariant  proportional to any</p>
<p>hexagon. The obvious difference is that  is the hypotenuse and  a right angle side. The</p>
<p>interchange of sides b and c is one aspect, the fact that  means that although</p>
<p> is a proportion that can occur, but not if b is approached as the absolute value</p>
<p>, e.g. the circumference of a circle with radius  is , the</p>
<p>circumference of a circle with radius  is proportionally , but in absolute terms . As is with</p>
<p> if for a right angled triangle </p>
<h2 id="sec-9">Where does the unity chord live</h2>

<h2 id="sec-11">The forties</h2>
<p>Because the total cycle over the quadrant stretches  must be the unit increment</p>
<p>per cycle, . Each  period represented by , projects on a  plane and</p>
<p>represents the traversed angle  as function of area. The angle progresses in steps of </p>
<p>or  dependent on chosen projection . In</p>
<p>short, the decimal system emerges from the sexagesimal expanding/decreasing area as it takes 10</p>
<p>incremental periods to complete 60 parts. Note that these 10 periods are grouped in 2 cycles of</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Powers of ten to infinity</p>
<p>In table 5.1: Hexagonal equilibrium, the column  indicates that</p>
<p> occurs in the span of .</p>
<p>This translates to a span of  in which 2 cycles of  each account</p>
<p>for , a tenfold increase of the chord  over the span of the triangular projection,</p>
<p>see table 4.1: Discrete triangular - Continues projection plane, and figure 5.2:Planck base - Unity chord,</p>
<p>and likewise the primorial root 2 approach ,</p>
<p>By some measure, the chords expand or decrease in size with a factor 10 and everything apparently</p>
<p>blows up. But there is a solution that at its core has dark energy and zeta zero&#x27;s intimately entangled</p>
<p>in a numerical expansion that will make perfect sense. But first why chords do not resize absolutely,</p>
<p>only relatively.</p>
<p>In the QGF configuration the length of the chords of each n-gon is  and approaches a</p>
<p>length of , . This limit to the chord length is the key that allows us to define a</p>
<p>physical model from which the QGF as first principle emerges and by this the foundation under the</p>
<p>otherwise unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in modeling the observed universe and its</p>
<p>physical interactions.</p>
<p>The natural state as repository of</p>
<p>potential</p>
<p>The n-chords in the QGF have their own “orbits” at the geometric radius </p>
<p>(relative to the pole at ). All QGF chords are periodic chords, but will only be revealed as such when</p>
<p>expressed by a modulated repository of potential. In the physical implementation of the QGF the pole</p>
<p>at  is absolute, it represents the outer limit of a complete convex set.</p>
<p>In figure 7.3: QGF natural state, the horizontal shaded bar encloses a vertical range,</p>
<p> and stretches over the range . The lower end is</p>
<p> because the chord at  is in fact the  orthogonal chord at infinity</p>
<p>projected as a hexagonal chord under . Herein we find the two configurations responsible for the</p>
<p> vs  as mentioned under subsection 7 - Powers of ten to infinity. The whole range between the</p>
<p>pole and infinity gets confined to the maximum radius  and the accumulated sum translates,</p>

<p>Compression is the answer to surplus chords , in table 7.2:Chord length and relative density, the</p>
<p>column n starts at n=6. In their geometric identity all chords for n&lt;7 can be inscribed n times at x=n.</p>
<p>The chords for n&gt;6 that are part of the same set do not fit any other x-coordinate because the QGF</p>
<p>framework is designed this way, absolute position, absolute size, each chord represents a unique</p>
<p>coordinate.</p>
<p>The column  in table 7.2: Chord length and relative density, lists the calculated length of the chords</p>
<p>at their designated geometric x coordinate, starting with  and thereafter the chords get</p>
<p>progressively larger.</p>

<p>“surplus” shows the amount of chords the local hexagon does not allow for if not expressed as</p>

<p>The n-chords n&gt;6 exist on their own unique radius between x=6 and . For each radius the</p>
<p>resulting chord length is unique, .</p>
<p>The first possible fit is a hexagon, the radius defines the chord length and hence the compression</p>
<p>factor. This sets up a stack of hexagons that in the surplus chords mimic the configuration of a</p>
<p>quantum harmonic oscillator with energy level . The layers are tuned to the integer surplus for</p>
<p>each hexagon, see table 7.2: Chord length and relative density, but that integer surplus defines n-</p>
<p>chords that are unique real values .</p>
<p>E.g. The 7-chord projects geometrically beyond . The 7-chord has a length of</p>
<p>, that is, all 7 chords of them, but only 6 chords will fit the</p>
<p>circumference at , the remaining chord (wave) can be envisioned as bouncing</p>
<p>between the walls forming a standing wave, see figure 7.5 particle-in-a-box, first level.</p>
<p>The largest n-gon in the QGF that fits the circumference is the 6-gon, this is the lowest energy state</p>
<p>equivalent in a physical setting, fits snug without surplus to bounce around. Given a repository of</p>
<p>potential with a infinitely hard rigid border, the ultimate particle in a box example must be the</p>
<p>universe itself.</p>
<p>Prime interference</p>
<p>The surplus as listed in table 7.2: Chord length and relative density, is at first glance represented by</p>
<p>the set of Natural numbers , but column  tells a different story. In fact it is not even a triangular</p>
<p>number set because each diagonal has n copies of column , as it should because the diagonals</p>
<p>represent all the chords of the associated n-gon.</p>
<p>Using the analogy of a De Broglie wave we can envision each diagonal to represent a string of specific</p>
<p>density “surplus”. Like tuning a snare on an instrument the “surplus” can be envisioned as a measure</p>
<p>of tension on the string. Note that in abstract geometric sense there is no such thing as a , all n-</p>
<p>gons occupy there natural coordinate, “fit snugly” and have no “surplus” chords. The relative density is</p>
<p>given by the quotient  and of vital importance. Unlike  the surplus consists of values</p>
<p>that are not unit values but are more prime-like. It is as if putting the primes in one to one</p>
<p>correspondence with the natural numbers, but not by assigning a number, in stead grouping those</p>
<p>primes in n copies, as in matrix 7.13.x=2π</p>

<p>This does not seem very useful, but matrix 7.12 is in fact analogues to this arrangement. The set of</p>
<p>chords within a n-gon are equivalent but differ from all other chords in the QGF. The hexagonal</p>
<p>structure splits those n-chords per diagonal over 6 chords and gives the relative density  for each</p>
<p>diagonal, forming a string with a specific density. This specific density in physical sense is of vital</p>
<p>importance, the resonance frequencies of such ‘strings’ can be equated to the set of prime numbers</p>
<p>among the Natural numbers , each chord acts like a snare uniquely tuned for the n-gon. The</p>
<p>comparison with prime numbers is a valid one, be it that every hexagon consists of 6 chords of that</p>
<p>specific density. Naively one could make the comparison that electrons, all possessing the same set of</p>
<p>properties could be modeled by a n-gon of the size n-electrons in the universe. The QGF is broader</p>
<p>than representing one singular set, a less naive representation is forthcoming. All being well, but can</p>
<p>the assumption of a repository of potential structured like the QGF be verified in natural systems.</p>
<p>Observations</p>
<p>This specific density is probably linked to observed features like present in hexagonal basalt, the</p>
<p>fracture pattern of gradually dried mud planes or for instance the hexagonal features at the north</p>
<p>pole of Saturn. A volatile environment comes slowly to rest and at certain point the system organizes</p>
<p>into an equilibrium. Mud flats dry out faster than a few 1000 of basalt cools down, the hexagonal</p>
<p>structure is more obvious in columnar basalt than in the crack pattern of a mud plane. The specific</p>
<p>pattern at Saturn&#x27;s north pole exists in a rather volatile atmosphere as the pattern is thought to be</p>
<p>caused by jet streams and can be modeled to appear in simulations of atmospheric conditions. The</p>
<p>more granular the subset, the less obvious the hexagonal equilibrium. Recognizing any odd pattern is</p>
<p>part of being human, so we need a process to connect the dots. Geometrically we can appreciate</p>
<p>numerical indicators that might be labeled as “density” , but a label does not cause behavior.</p>
<p>Geometric, density dependent primes</p>
<p>No such thing as abstract density, but in a physical system any variation in density can cause “strings”</p>
<p>to match density with adjacent “strings” (hexagons) in the  lattice. A propagating wave on one n-</p>
<p>gon can reroute, either temporarily or periodically during density fluctuations. This dynamic enables</p>
<p>strings that in the base state differ in density to transfer potential, to and fro, notably quantified in</p>
<p>character. Of course for something to fluctuate it needs to exist. Particle accelerators collide blobs of</p>
<p>energy, those do exist, scientist wack those blobs and study the way the energy dissipates. But what</p>
<p>do those “blobs” consist off is the question we hope to answer. The link between the abstraction of</p>
<p>chords and physics can be made via the pair correlation function.</p>
<p>Pair correlation</p>
<p>In 1972 at the Institute of Advanced Study Freeman Dyson and Hugh Montgomery compared notes.</p>
<p>Hugh Montgomery found that  is the theoretical prediction for two-point correlations</p>
<p>in the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. According to Freeman Dyson⎡</p>

<p>surface area encoded in the zeta zeros. The area inside the QGF pole is represented by the 21 zeta</p>
<p>zeros in level 1 and therefor all chords that project inside the pole for every scale invariant natural</p>
<p>state of the QGF are represented.</p>
<p>Interlaced zeta and repulsion</p>
<p>Each of the levels has a fixed number of zeros and a fixed range in which the zeros project, this is</p>
<p>illustrated in figure 7.11: Interlaced zeta zero.</p>
<p>It is in the projection of level 1,  that the</p>
<p>characteristic level repulsion pattern of spacing between zeta zeros begins to show.</p>
<p>The progression of the levels as seen in figure 7.11 shows that the lower range becomes progressively</p>
<p>denser. Level 2  only starts intruding into</p>
<p>Level 1 at  as it projects past .</p>
<p>Naturally in pieces</p>
<p>All the natural numbers are interlaced in parts. For every  there are  representing that</p>
<p>number that diffusely interlace on the real axis. The number of zeta zeros is an area</p>
<p> and each zero is an area the size of , e.g. to represent the number n=7, 7</p>
<p>uniquely sized  project on the real axis, not as a continuous string of zeros, but spread out as dots</p>
<p>on a rubber sheet, like galaxies spreading with the expansion of space. As shown in figure</p>
<p>7.12:Interlaced zeta zero detail, this is not a loosely formulated analogy, it is a quite accurate</p>
<p>description of the process involved. The figure shows the geometric spreading of zeta zeros where the</p>
<p>first zero on the left of level 1 is from number . The eight squares on</p>
<p>level 2, making up the range for number  to </p>

<p>In fact there are more numbers interlaced in the range for . From the first 950 zeta zeros (up</p>
<p>to 9 decimal places suffices in this region), 134 zeros spread over the first 4 levels are included in the</p>
<p>range  to .</p>
<p>1 zero from level 1, our </p>
<p>8 zeros from the second level (obviously) </p>
<p>32 zeros from level 3</p>
<p>93 zeros from level 4 </p>
<p>All between  to , see the diagonal indicated by  in matrix [eq:n-in-pieces].</p>
<p>This does not mean that the distribution is solved by the depiction of levels in matrix [eq:n-in-pieces]</p>
<p>because as seen  wedges between  and the second zero of</p>
<p> does not. The diagonals must depict a unique sequence of area that can be equated to</p>
<p>a natural number, but as seen that area gets stretched out, fragmented beyond recognition. But</p>
<p>seemingly not ad infinitum so, it is like a shifting panel of affected area (figure 7.11: Interlaced zeta</p>
<p>zero). What happens is that when a larger range is selected, observed granularity increases</p>
<p>proportionally. In fact we know of such a property occurring in the physical realm and we alluded to it</p>
<p>before, it is the expansion of space itself. It seems that with the expansion of space the energy content</p>
<p>does not get diluted, local conditions remain stable while space expands into oblivion.</p>
<p>What is proposed here is not to interpret the measured effect as “expansion of space”, but as artifact</p>
<p>of observing space from a regressing surface area. One that continuously decreases its radial distance</p>
<p>to the singularity at the center, but expressed as a phase shift that enforces local parameters to</p>
<p>maintain stability. e.g. similar to the constant temperature at the melting point of water ice, or boiling</p>
<p>point of water. Selecting a greater subset by application of some arbitrary coordinate system increases</p>
<p>local granularity relative to that coordinate system. This intuition seems confirmed by figures 7.11 and</p>
<p>7.12, as it is clear that the levels condense ever increasing sets of zeta zeros in proportionally</p>
<p>compacter stretches of the real line (y-axis), see figures 7.13: decent for zeta n, and 7.14: descent for</p>
<p>levels. From a perspective of scale in variance each level must in some sense be the fractal sibling of</p>
<p>the previous level. This implies that the stable configuration, section 7 - Stable QGF configuration,</p>
<p>holds the complete set of prime numbers, and all other primes are in some sense ghostS of</p>

<p>Not “ghosts” in the sense of figments of the imagination, we can all count and apply the sieve of</p>
<p>Eratosthenes, but like a mirage projects a distant image in the dessert. There is something projected</p>
<p>that definitely does exist, only not there were its images appears to be. Figure 7.14: descent for levels,</p>
<p>implies that all cycles lay within the previous cycles, where figure 7.11; interlaced zeta zeros, provides</p>
<p>kind of a mirage where each level seems to project some distinct part of the continuum. It is a bit</p>
<p>counter intuitive but the things being stuffed are not numbers, what is stuffed are markers of spaces</p>
<p>between numbers, as if becomes apparent that those spaces are conglomerates of a finer grained</p>
<p>subset. What seems to be the case is that prime numbers are in some sense coordinates on the M-</p>
<p>brane mono-surface from where the horizon encloses rational fractions of the available space. It</p>
<p>seems that prime numbers are defined by being rational multiples of zeta zeros, and not just rational</p>
<p>multiples, but groups of multiples in specific order that exactly match some set of units shaping some</p>
<p>exact curvature of (prime) unit surface area. The conclusion must be that although  are seen as</p>
<p>the sum of equal partitions,  each 1 of them is one of a kind and has a specific size</p>
<p>(area / curvature). E.g.  Those spaces together are</p>
<p>responsible for the expanding surface area, filling the diagonal of the triangular plane</p>
<p> level by level, each level unique in number and spread of zeta zeros.</p>
<p>Prime like distribution for all n</p>
<p>This of course means that the zeta zeros by themselves say nothing special about the distribution of</p>
<p>primes. Each level spreads the represented natural numbers out over that level in n parts. E.g</p>
<p> zeros. The cumulative effect is the apparent accretion of surface</p>
<p>area as found in the projection plane model. The zeta zeros by their triangular distribution represent</p>
<p>an area , the area fills up over the diagonal as</p>
<p> see matrix 7.16: n in pieces. Returning to the</p>
<p>triangular plane and its diagonal , at the end only  remains but yes, the zeta</p>
<p>zeros all line up on that diagonal, because in the triangular projection all of them lay on the diagonal of</p>
<p>the triangular plane. In the limit the whole  of them, any natural number, prime or not. QED for then∈N</p>

<p>Riemann hypothesis, at least for as far as the QGF goes. It is a bit frustrating to look at this picture and</p>
<p>realize that the nth (prime) number is distributed over that area in n parts, infinitely diffuse in spread,</p>
<p>how many time one wonders “where the (expletive) does that number live”. The geometric primes as</p>
<p>n-gon are as prime as it gets. But how to make the connection between prime numbers having a</p>
<p>specific location in , the distinct x coordinate for the geometric primes and the, ever shifting,</p>
<p>distribution of the zeta zeros. One answer is that the zeta zeros are even more prime than the</p>
<p>geometric primes, literally so because  e.g.</p>
<p>, 3 zeros each representing a unique chord as we are about to see.</p>
<p>Zetas walk about on the diagonal</p>
<p>The QGF chords resemble geometric primes in abstract sense, none divides the other, each can be</p>
<p>seen as a uniquely tuned string. The zeta zeros however do something different in the sense that they</p>
<p>clearly define a n-gon that is not regular, but has ever increasing chord length defined by consecutive</p>
<p>zeta zeros. Unlike the geometric chords that describe those of a hexagon, the chords represented by</p>
<p>the zeta zeros have a slightly higher value for each converted zero. The zeros are grouped according to</p>
<p>the triangular schema, but each zeta zero produces a unique chord length. Because of this unique</p>
<p>chord length the zeta zeros cannot form a regular n-gon. We know however by the triangular order</p>
<p>that they are n-gon like. One interpretation is that the deflection of the angles is as expected for an n-</p>
<p>gon , and thus the discrepancy in size must be due to “departing the circumscribed arc at </p>
<p>” under condition of a actively shrinking radius and “landing on the circumscribed arc at  ” . This is</p>
<p>what is modeled in figure 7.15: Zeta zeros walk about.</p>
<p>The zeta zeros follow some intermediate path that seem to describe chords of a spiral that for each</p>
<p>set add up to 360 degrees, see matrix 7.17: zeta angle progression.</p>
<p>The construction of figure 7.15: zeta zeros walk about, is straight forward. Project the x-value, rotate</p>
<p>anti clockwise over the associated accumulative angle and connect to the end of the previous chord.</p>

<p>For the configuration inside the pole 4 such  blocks affected area, labeled A to D are stacked</p>
<p>along the diagonal. The total affected area . Each  shows a upper</p>
<p>right value that is there as chain link to the left lower cell of the following block, indicating the chain</p>
<p>along the diagonal. Thus a diagonal of 7 primes plus the initial lower left 1 is formed summing up to</p>
<p>. The total of primes in this  configuration</p>
<p>sum op to 100 (excluding the lower left 1), including primes 2 and 3 not on the orthogonal diagonal.</p>
<p>This gives a  ratio that we register as the primorial delta . The pattern follows figure 4.9:</p>
<p>Projection plane regression, in its stacking of affected area,</p>
<p>and causes the primes  to line up along the diagonal. In the next image,</p>
<p>figure 7.18: Orthogonal succession, on the left the ordening of the zeta zeros is superimposed on the</p>
<p>triangular plane. On the right we find numerically a bad fit for the stack of primes to the zeta zero</p>
<p>indices, however, the affected area did not change, merely a swapping of square units occurred .</p>
<p>The zeta zeros are projected in their ‘natural’ n-gon position. The columns are numbered according to</p>
<p>the n-gon diagonals and therefor map the zeta groups to individual natural numbers. The prime</p>
<p>numbers in the index row below (shaded yellow) do not line up to the superimposed stack of primes.</p>
<p>The index row is there to indicate the zeta groupings and have no direct relation to the stack of</p>
