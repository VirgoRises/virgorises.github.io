Strange attractor
Side note new WB: Chaos, strange attractors
The underlaying hypothesis does provide a handle on the foundation of
chaos, strange attractors and fluid dynamics. This because the natural
numbers are conglomerates of groups of unique zeta zeros, groups of which
the zeta zero members are infinitely diffusely distributed amongst the whole
set of zeta zeros.
This distribution causes a, in principle, deterministic set of channels
available for potential distribution. The model for this is given in the
hexagonal  structure of the QGF. The  structure is hypothesized to
encode for 3-dimensional degrees of freedom in its hexagonal structure

Why philosophy
Here the &#x27;Why should&#x27; is meant in a true sense of causal reasoning, because this abstract
mathematical construct is contingent on (caused by) an actual point of lowest potential energy in a
dynamic process. This seems a reversal of logic, because an abstract mathematical construct can be
used to model reality, but how can the abstract construct &#x27;not exist&#x27; absent of a physical reality?
This is not some futile excercise in making a problem where non exist. In fact, this is modeled in the
Quadrature Geometric Framework (QGF), chapter 7, where the values of the zeta zeros geometrically
project outside the universe of possible coordinates, and their &#x27;natural position, character&#x27; is deduced
from the hypothesized physical structure underlaying the model. The abstraction cannot
Physical reality is the source of experimentally determined energy levels of heavy nuclei, the
eigenvalues of Gaussian Hermitian matrices that successfully model those quantum systems, and
mathematical research in the distribution of prime numbers, produced a list of computed non trivial
zeta zeros (billions of them). All share characteristics with values obtained from the QGF. See figure
F7.07 that shows the graph for the pair correlation function (lower series) that models the pair
correlation as found in zeta zeros, eigenvalues, and energy levels, and the list of values found in the
QGF (upper series).→ → =2π

scratch primorial hexagon
The value  is , which is closely related to the conversion
factor we found by analyzing the primorial function in chapter 3.
In figure F3.04 we see the construction of the primorial hexagon (chapter 3) by means of a vesica
pisces construction. The apex of the first chord of a hexagon has (x,y) coordinate
. The hexagon is the only n-gon that has a chord length equal to its
radius, which makes it easy to construct with a set of compasses.
The conversion factor  is, in fact, part of the length of the radius in figure F3.04. This because
the construction of the hexagon is used as the basis for the further construction of the QGF. The QGF
has a pole at , or for the keen observer at , which= ≈0.8660254038… rq3

makes that  and therefor plots at position  of the pole.
The pole is most easy to construct if one chooses two points on a line and then define the distance to
be 8 units. From there it is easy to construct subdivisions to unit size, and divide the unit between 6 an
7 in four equal parts.
The other key in the conversion factor is . Note that
 implies a hop over an infinity of elements from both  and , not an infinitely
close approach between adjacent values as, for instance, the Dedekind cut. For now it suffices to see
qc as a pointer over a horizon between .
It is this horizon that parts the Cartesian discrete triangular plane  from the Cartesian continuous
projection plane . Therefore

Zeta zero&#x27;s, scale invariant proportion
In chapter 2, The spatial aspect of zeta, we found that the zeta zeros are in fact a scale invariant
proportion that can be mapped to a unit radius, see table T2.02.
The unit radius scaled to 2 π :1, if we (naively) consider that the function value of ζ (s) is of the format
, then the limit:
To scale the denominator with the numerator we apply the factorial function as if the exponent of the
numerator π is the counting number :
This results in a simple scaling methodology where the denominator approaches the value of the
chosen numerator, i.e., π , π, π,...:6=24×1

Maybe a transition between triangular numbers, e.g. T.
But even if we consider transitions between triangular numbers, each such transition is nothing more,
or less, then an additive step to the next natural number, e.g., filling the diagonals
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,...,15,...}. Therefor all these partitions are merely a subset of the rational
numbers q ∈ℚ . Missing from this set of partitions are an infinity of q ∈ℚ  and x ∈ℝ  between each set of
transitional q ∈ℚ .
Consider the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). The triangular numbers, like ℚ , are countable infinite, and
have cardinality ℵ.

01_NutshellReadMore.html#:~:text=This%20length%20is%20the%20Planck,

numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers
used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is
a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The transfinite
cardinal numbers, often denoted using the Hebrew symbol  (aleph)
followed by a subscript, describe the sizes of infinite sets.
