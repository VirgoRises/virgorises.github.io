      <h2 id="why">Why the Basel problem</h2>
      <p>The focus in this document is not on the classic Riemann zeta function involving Complex Analysis.</p>
      <p>However, the results provide a solution to the distribution of the zeta zeros and consequently an answer to the Riemann hypothesis.</p>
      <p>The problem that superseded the Riemann zeta function, the “Basel Problem”, is named after the Swiss city. At the University of Basel the Bernoulli brothers successively served as professor of mathematics (Jakob, 1687–1705; Johann, 1705–1748). Jakob Bernoulli stated the problem: find a closed form for the infinite series of reciprocal squares of the natural numbers. This is closely related to the harmonic series, for which the Bernoulli brothers found a proof of divergence.</p>
      <p>In essence this paper starts in 1735, the year that Leonhard Euler in St. Petersburg found the answer to the Basel problem: he found the closed (exact) form surprisingly to add up to an irrational number.</p>

      <h2 id="sum">The sum formula</h2>
      <p>The zeta function for \(s=2\) is the infinite sum of reciprocal squares of the natural numbers:</p>
      <p>\[ \zeta(2) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots \]</p>
      <p>The infinite sum of the shaded squares adds up to a fraction of a square. The closed form indicates that rational squares add up to a fraction of an irrational surface with sides \(\pi\). It is in precisely this mapping that an alternative pathway for investigation presented itself.</p>

      <h2 id="product">The product formula</h2>
      <p>The zeta function for \(s=2\) can also be stated as a product over the primes:</p>
      <p>\[ \zeta(2) \;=\; \prod_{p \ \text{prime}} \frac{1}{1 - p^{-2}} \;=\; \prod_{p \ \text{prime}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p^2}\right)^{-1} .\]</p>
      <p>This can be represented as a product of square area ratios. The ratio between \(3^2\) and \(4^2\) does not appear because \(4\) is not a prime number. The rational quotients multiply out to an irrational square with sides \(\pi\).</p>

      <h2 id="equality">The sum/product equality</h2>
      <p>The sum of the reciprocal squares of the natural numbers equals an infinite product whose factors iterate over all prime numbers. The geometric projection of the sum and product formulas shows the evolution of the formula to the result as a function of area:</p>
      <p>\[ \zeta(2) \;=\; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^2} \;=\; \prod_{p \ \text{prime}} \frac{1}{1 - p^{-2}} \;=\; \frac{\pi^2}{6} .\]</p>

      <h2 id="rationals">Rational and Real numbers</h2>
      <p>The rationals are a dense subset of the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is that rational numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions as regular continued fractions.</p>
      <p>A sum or product of rational quantities resulting in a real number value raises a philosophical question: is the result \(\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6\) a real number “reached” by the rationals, or an infinitely close rational approximation?</p>
