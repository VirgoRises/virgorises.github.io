<p>Wikipedia: The inverse square law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law)</p>
<p>The inverse square law, in physics, is any physical law stating that a specified physical quantity or</p>
<p>intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical</p>
<p>quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to</p>
<p>point-source radiation into three-dimensional space. A similar proportional symmetry exists between</p>
<p>the result  and the spherical volume enclosed by a surface area , expressed as</p>
<p>twice the radius of such a volume.</p>
<h2 id="sec-9">The structure of Volume over zeta</h2>
<p>The value volume over zeta is exactly twice the radius calculated for a sphere with . The</p>
<p>function value  represents a ratio which seems to sit in the middle of some dynamic</p>
<p>process involving the expansion of a sphere. This becomes clear if we dissect the structure. The ratio</p>
<p> has the form</p>
<p>Assume that  is proportional to the radius of some next volume, the infinite sum of  can</p>
<p>be interpreted as the process that completes the inflation (by doubling of radius) from  up to</p>
<p>. The assumed inflation has to start from some initial volume.</p>
<p>This  is the volume after completion of , therefore a division by 8 gives the initial volume:</p>
<p> is the supposed start volume. This numerical result is not very</p>
<p>informative, a better way is to use scale invariant ratios.</p>
<h2 id="sec-10">The scale invariant ratios</h2>
<p> itself is the end stage of a previous cycle</p>

<p>The interpretation of volume over zeta in light of the scale invariant ratios indicates a (snapshot of a)</p>
<p>dynamic structure of 3 consecutive stages of inflation. Stages  and  represent the value for</p>
<p>the middle volume that is reached at completion of the zeta function.</p>
<p>To emphasize: , refers to twice the radius associated with , *. This means that  by</p>
<p>method of completing the pattern must have a relative radius of , because under this</p>
<p>scheme volume over zeta returns twice the relative radius of the sphere. Now by logic of ratio,</p>
<p>The surface area of a sphere grows with a factor 4 by doubling the radius. Thus the volume of the</p>
<p>current iteration,  divided by the radius of the consecutive volume , which is in fact the</p>
<p>double radius found with , gives the proportional multiplication factor of surface area by doubling</p>
<p>of radius. Observe that it simultaneously represents a growth factor of 4, ass well the scale invariant</p>
<p>size of the current surface area.</p>
<p>In equation ,  does refer to the surface area of the second iteration., e.g.</p>
<p>, but in equation , , in context of the ratio where  refers to the</p>
<p>consecutive volume, refers to the constant rate of growth of surface area between iterations. This</p>
<p>aspect of a common ratio is also present for volume and radius, however, equation  as a ratio,</p>
<p>will proof to be crucial. The ratio  is a constant value by necessity in this scheme, as we will</p>
<p>see shortly.</p>
<p>The intimate relation (eq. ) between the numerator and denominator begs for an explanation.</p>
<p>Taken in unison they both encode for spherical aspects, but do so following different sequences</p>
<p>involving the presumed spatial properties. A seemingly three dimensional structure hovers just below</p>
<p>the surface of the zeta function. However, it concerns an abstract object, abstract objects do not take</p>
<p>up space in a physical sense. And although clear spatial aspects are identified, there are no spatial</p>
<p>aspects discernible in the infinite sum/product of the zeta function itself, nor is there any connection</p>
<p>with 3-dimensional attributes in the zeta algorithm. This lack of spatial properties might point to the</p>
<p>outline of an abstract mathematical object that can be identified as a first principle under-laying the</p>
<p>emergence of physical three dimensional structure.</p>
<h2 id="sec-11">Geometric progression</h2>
<p>Nothing in the abstraction of the zeta function indicates a connection to spherical geometry. The zeta</p>
<p>function arrives at the same answer by two distinct procedures, the additive sum formula </p>
<p>and the multiplicative product formula . At the core we find arithmetic and</p>
<p>geometric sequences that outline spherical attributes interwoven in the set of rational numbers .</p>
<p>Such abstract sequences by themselves,however, are not sufficient to cause/project spherical</p>
<p>attributes in physical sense.</p>

<p>Q</p>
<p>In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of</p>
<p>numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero</p>
<p>number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression</p>
<p>with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.</p>
<p>Examples of a geometric sequence are powers  of a fixed number r, such as  and . The general</p>
<p>form of a geometric sequence is  where  is the common ratio and a is a</p>
<p>scale factor, equal to the sequence&#x27;s start value.</p>
<h2 id="sec-12">Progression and common ratios</h2>
<p>The numerator of the general pattern (see equation ), is simply expressed starting at</p>
<p> and then progresses with a common ratio of 2.</p>
<p>Thus encoding an increasing volume as function of a doubling radius in a geometric progression with a</p>
<p>common ratio 2,</p>
<p>This, given the context, is indeed a sequence to encode for an expanding sphere, but void of proper</p>
<p>context it is an arbitrary, unwarranted, choice and should just be interpreted as some linear sequence.</p>
<p>The second part expressed in the denominator, is more specific and gives clues how to interpret the</p>
<p>ratio as a whole. The value of the denominator is itself a ratio</p>
<p>Here the numerator starts at  and progresses with a common ratio of 8, .</p>
<p>Note that this sequence is encoded as an 8-fold increase of volume proportional to a doubling of the</p>
<p>radius. Yet another linear expression to encode for an expanding sphere given the context in which it</p>
<p>is found. In the denominator the value represents  of the volume in the numerator. This simple</p>
<p>property makes that whole ratio of the denominator for each instance equal to 4, and thus encodes a</p>
<p>static measure of surface area. And this is however simple, just as it should be, because found is a</p>
<p>spatial ratio that encodes a ratio of volume over surface area at the completion of the infinite</p>
<p>sum/product ,</p>
<p>Inevitable self organisation</p>
<p>This is the pattern recognized in the inverse square law and the geometric progression of surface area</p>
<p>by a common factor of 4, for each consecutive doubling of radius. And yes, this  only holds for</p>
<p>the infinite sum/product . The challenge is therefore to provide a natural mechanism</p>
<p>which independent of the abstraction, can be shown to necessarily emerge from some identifiable first</p>
<p>condition and must self organizes such that it reflects the abstraction. Equation  becomes,rk2k3k</p>

<p>The ratio as a whole reflects the same geometric sequence as the numerator , it encodes an</p>
<p>increasing volume as function of the radius being doubled in a geometric progression</p>
<p>the only difference is that the sequence lags two iterations behind. And in fact, both expressions</p>
<p>(numerator and ratio overall) will proof to be sequences of increasing surface area:</p>
<p>Making sense of zeta</p>
<p>It makes sense to designate surface area as the primary expression of the zeta function because it is</p>
<p>present as common ratio of the combined expression in numerator and denominator. Apparently the</p>
<p>zeta function expresses a continuous increment in surface area that does not ‘enclose’ a volume, but</p>
<p>IS the volume.</p>
<p>Figure 2.01 SA as a Volume</p>
<p>A graphical impression of a volume resulting from wrapped surface area. Fact is that in the geometric</p>
<p>sequences any sense of continuous curvature is absent. It is the structure of the numerator and</p>
<p>denominator of  that allows us to envision the trace of a spherical object shaped like a 3d</p>
<p>spiral of surface area (fig. volume mbrane monosheet). It seems that the abstract sum exposes</p>
<p>aspects that are spatial in nature, as if the algorithm  actually traces some 3d object while</p>
<p>traversing the infinite series. The proposed hypothesis is the exact opposite such that the 3d structural</p>
<p>aspects observed in nature, the tangible spatial aspects of &#x27;space&#x27;, might be merely an illusion. This</p>
<p>presumed illusory aspect of 3-dimensional spatial aspect is also recognized in the holographic</p>
<p>principle. [Wikipedia: Real numbers and topological properties][5] The rationals are a dense subset of</p>
<p>the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is</p>
<p>that rational numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions as regular continued fractions. In</p>
<p>light of the topological argument, sec based on the sum of reciprocal squares of the natural numbers,</p>
<p>one would not suspect such a sum to produce anything else but a rational value. Continuity as</p>
<p>property of the Real numbers will be exposed as an illusion caused by topological projection, whereby</p>

<p>Contrasting discrete and continuous aspects</p>
<p>The spatial ratio, (equation ) is discrete, consists of rational values which describe scale</p>
<p>invariant ratios. This structure of scale invariant ratios can be interpreted in terms of spherical</p>
<p>geometry. The structure  as limit of the product , indicates that  refers to</p>
<p>an end volume, and that  refers to  the surface area of this volume . This leaves the</p>
<p>impression that the infinite product of the zeta function represents a complete cycle during which</p>
<p>some volume expands by doubling of its radius, from the first term of the infinite series to the last.</p>
<p>Abstract concepts do not have spatial properties nor do they exhibit dynamic behavior in any physical</p>
<p>sense, so what does &#x27;some volume expands by doubling of its radius&#x27; in essence mean? Postulated is</p>
<p>an abstract spatial object under-laying the nature of numbers. This abstraction exposes spherical</p>
<p>properties like radius, circumference and volume detached from any apparent physical context</p>
<p>Detached from spatial dimensions</p>
<p>The detachment from spatial dimensions is clear because the zeta algorithm does not operate on a</p>
<p>data set obtained from a spatial context, be it sampled from nature or derived from some abstract</p>
<p>model of nature. All that is derived from the function value  are patterns that match</p>
<p>geometric sequences and a apparently Real number function value that might be a infinitely close</p>
<p>rational approximation. The conjecture is that discrete accumulation, be it abstract numerically or</p>
<p>wave/particle like as observed in physics, follows a first principle that might be described as &#x27;pre-</p>
<p>mathematical&#x27;. This first principle forces both numerical abstract models and/or physical reality to</p>
<p>emerge such that the structure of both systems are clearly of common descent but not necessarily</p>
<p>contingent on each other. In other words, this first principle must be self evidently present in abstract</p>
<p>numerical models and physical systems such that it has explanatory power for the effectiveness of</p>
<p>mathematics in modeling natural systems, or reversely, the ability to gain new mathematical insight</p>
<p>from observing nature.</p>
<p>Ab initio principle</p>
<p>The hypothesized &#x27;pre-mathematical&#x27; first principle, as will be presented, follows from the theory of</p>
<p>convex sets and is surprisingly simple to recognize in context of physical reality. It is in the physical</p>
<p>implementation that we find the bridge to the Riemann zeta function and the proof for the conjecture</p>
<p>&#x27;all zeros have real part one half&#x27;. This means that a model for the distribution of the zeta zeros and</p>
<p>the source for particle repulsion will be known from first principle and likewise rooted in basic</p>
<p>mathematical principles. As stated in chapter 1, we will not use complex analysis, we will arrive at the</p>
<p>zeta zeros from another angle. For this we build a new analytic tool and start by contrasting the</p>
<p>mathematical abstraction of the sum of reciprocal squares and its supposed spatial attributes against</p>
<p>spatial attributes of spherical geometry as observed in natural systems.</p>

<p>6surfacearea</p>
<p>somevalue(02.18)</p>
<p>The zeta function value seems to indicate the inflation of a volume with respect to an initial volume. It</p>
<p>does so because it has in it the radius for the successive cycle of inflation. Clearly any numerical</p>
<p>quantity derived from appropriate context can be interpreted to represent length, area, volume, time,</p>
<p>any applicable dimensional quality. Such a context is for the zeta function, an infinite product over the</p>
<p>primes (all primes) or infinite sum over the natural numbers (all numbers) not obvious at all. Why do</p>
<p>we find a relation to the inverse square law and spherical geometry? Numerically a ‘volume’ has</p>
<p>inflated, and the process expresses this in a value that encodes a spatial ratio (see equation ).</p>
<p>The ratio  appears to be based on a surface area  and must thus be proportional to the volume it</p>
<p>encloses. The first aspect to take note of is that the zeta function expresses no elements of spherical</p>
<p>geometry, i.e. Only rational numerical values, line segments if you will, are the sole constituents of the</p>
<p>function value. Because spatial aspects, if at all present, do not follow from the zeta algorithm, care</p>
<p>has to be taken not to inadvertently introduce spatial aspects. How to prevent erroneous introduction</p>
<p>of those aspects?</p>
<p>Consider the following formulas</p>
<p>In each case the spatial aspect is represented by either raising the radius to a power, or reversely,</p>
<p>taking the  of the value  for volume or  for surface area. The factors ()</p>
<p>and  represent the curvature detached from spatial aspects. The subject of investigation is why</p>
<p>the Real number value of  follows from, in essence, a rational context. We do assume</p>
<p>however that spatial attributes like volume,surface and length are illusory aspects of reality. So when</p>
<p>contrasting the apparent spatial aspects of the sum of reciprocal squares we have to take care not to</p>
<p>unwittingly introduce spatial aspects like  when the assumption is there are no</p>
<p>analogues to tangible spatial aspects represented in the sum of reciprocal squares.</p>
<p>Not from a spatial context or abstraction thereof</p>
<p>For instance if we cube a radius we define a volume, and reversely, if we apply the formula</p>
<p> the assumption is that  represents a volume, be it derived from some model with</p>
<p>spatial properties, or from measurements obtained from some spatial context. The function</p>
<p> represents neither the former nor the latter, therefor, to take a cube root in this context,</p>
<p>for instance , is in essence an operation that presupposes volume, and thus introduces a</p>
<p>spatial context in the results. A context not present in the zeta function algorithm to begin with.</p>
<p>Therefore the correct action is to obtain the initial- and end-radius conform the formula ,</p>
<p>but omit reducing spatial aspects as if they represent volume. This simply means to stop short of</p>
<p>reducing the cubic root in order to obtain the regular 1-dimensional radius, but in stead work with the</p>
<p>cubed value as is: . Simply put, if the question “who or what cubed that value?”, can not be</p>
<p>answered, then assume it is not cubed at all, after all, the function  is nothing more then a</p>
<p>sum/product of rational values which as such has no relation to any spatial context. The cubed radius02.09</p>

<p> can be approached alternatively and has a deep connection to . This</p>
<p>connection leads to a two dimensional model that, like holographic models, causes an</p>

<p>spatial properties, a model is needed to explain how it is that we experience a 3 dimensional reality.</p>
<p>Spherical scale-invariant proportion</p>
<p>Assuming the zeta function encodes a scale-invariant proportion of surface area (SA), a rather naive</p>
<p>approach provides more insight. Mapping any value for  to a circumference, surface area</p>
<p>or for instance cubic value, can be achieved by using the appropriate numerator and retain</p>
<p>proportionality in the denominator, . A mapping of zeta for  gives</p>
<p>Mapping to a circumference</p>
<p>Scaling to  a circumference over a radius. Calculate the (s-1) derivative of the numerator</p>
<p>and preserve proportionality with respect to that derivative in the denominator. e.g. for  where</p>
<p>s=2, it takes the first derivative to map  to : :</p>
<p>Obviously the function value for  must be known in order to feed back in this formula, however, it</p>
<p>is the mapping that will provide insight into the inner structure of the zeta function.</p>
<p>This pattern will hold for all ‘s’. Because &#x27;s&#x27; is the exponent of the numerator, the algorithm can be</p>
<p>generalized for all ‘s’ by application of the factorial function. For s=5,</p>
<p>The (s-1) derivative of  translates to  and allows for the following closed formula for all s:</p>
<p>And because this is a ratio, proceed by simplifying to the first derivative of  by multiplying the</p>
<p>ratio with 2 over ‘s’ factorial, and map all  to the radius :=r3V</p>
