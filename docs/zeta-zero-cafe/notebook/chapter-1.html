Wikipedia: The inverse square law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law)
The inverse square law, in physics, is any physical law stating that a specified physical quantity or
intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical
quantity. The fundamental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution corresponding to
point-source radiation into three-dimensional space. A similar proportional symmetry exists between
the result  and the spherical volume enclosed by a surface area , expressed as
twice the radius of such a volume.
The structure of Volume over zeta
The value volume over zeta is exactly twice the radius calculated for a sphere with . The
function value  represents a ratio which seems to sit in the middle of some dynamic
process involving the expansion of a sphere. This becomes clear if we dissect the structure. The ratio
 has the form
Assume that  is proportional to the radius of some next volume, the infinite sum of  can
be interpreted as the process that completes the inflation (by doubling of radius) from  up to
. The assumed inflation has to start from some initial volume.
This  is the volume after completion of , therefore a division by 8 gives the initial volume:
 is the supposed start volume. This numerical result is not very
informative, a better way is to use scale invariant ratios.
The scale invariant ratios
 itself is the end stage of a previous cycle
 is the initial volume
Which makes , the end-stage of , thus relabel for clarity, 
 is the stage before the next volume, therefore ζ(s)=nπs

The interpretation of volume over zeta in light of the scale invariant ratios indicates a (snapshot of a)
dynamic structure of 3 consecutive stages of inflation. Stages  and  represent the value for
the middle volume that is reached at completion of the zeta function.
To emphasize: , refers to twice the radius associated with , *. This means that  by
method of completing the pattern must have a relative radius of , because under this
scheme volume over zeta returns twice the relative radius of the sphere. Now by logic of ratio,
The surface area of a sphere grows with a factor 4 by doubling the radius. Thus the volume of the
current iteration,  divided by the radius of the consecutive volume , which is in fact the
double radius found with , gives the proportional multiplication factor of surface area by doubling
of radius. Observe that it simultaneously represents a growth factor of 4, ass well the scale invariant
size of the current surface area.
In equation ,  does refer to the surface area of the second iteration., e.g.
, but in equation , , in context of the ratio where  refers to the
consecutive volume, refers to the constant rate of growth of surface area between iterations. This
aspect of a common ratio is also present for volume and radius, however, equation  as a ratio,
will proof to be crucial. The ratio  is a constant value by necessity in this scheme, as we will
see shortly.
The intimate relation (eq. ) between the numerator and denominator begs for an explanation.
Taken in unison they both encode for spherical aspects, but do so following different sequences
involving the presumed spatial properties. A seemingly three dimensional structure hovers just below
the surface of the zeta function. However, it concerns an abstract object, abstract objects do not take
up space in a physical sense. And although clear spatial aspects are identified, there are no spatial
aspects discernible in the infinite sum/product of the zeta function itself, nor is there any connection
with 3-dimensional attributes in the zeta algorithm. This lack of spatial properties might point to the
outline of an abstract mathematical object that can be identified as a first principle under-laying the
emergence of physical three dimensional structure.
Geometric progression
Nothing in the abstraction of the zeta function indicates a connection to spherical geometry. The zeta
function arrives at the same answer by two distinct procedures, the additive sum formula 
and the multiplicative product formula . At the core we find arithmetic and
geometric sequences that outline spherical attributes interwoven in the set of rational numbers .
Such abstract sequences by themselves,however, are not sufficient to cause/project spherical
attributes in physical sense.

Q
In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of
numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero
number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression
with common ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2.
Examples of a geometric sequence are powers  of a fixed number r, such as  and . The general
form of a geometric sequence is  where  is the common ratio and a is a
scale factor, equal to the sequence&#x27;s start value.
Progression and common ratios
The numerator of the general pattern (see equation ), is simply expressed starting at
 and then progresses with a common ratio of 2.
Thus encoding an increasing volume as function of a doubling radius in a geometric progression with a
common ratio 2,
This, given the context, is indeed a sequence to encode for an expanding sphere, but void of proper
context it is an arbitrary, unwarranted, choice and should just be interpreted as some linear sequence.
The second part expressed in the denominator, is more specific and gives clues how to interpret the
ratio as a whole. The value of the denominator is itself a ratio
Here the numerator starts at  and progresses with a common ratio of 8, .
Note that this sequence is encoded as an 8-fold increase of volume proportional to a doubling of the
radius. Yet another linear expression to encode for an expanding sphere given the context in which it
is found. In the denominator the value represents  of the volume in the numerator. This simple
property makes that whole ratio of the denominator for each instance equal to 4, and thus encodes a
static measure of surface area. And this is however simple, just as it should be, because found is a
spatial ratio that encodes a ratio of volume over surface area at the completion of the infinite
sum/product ,
Inevitable self organisation
This is the pattern recognized in the inverse square law and the geometric progression of surface area
by a common factor of 4, for each consecutive doubling of radius. And yes, this  only holds for
the infinite sum/product . The challenge is therefore to provide a natural mechanism
which independent of the abstraction, can be shown to necessarily emerge from some identifiable first
condition and must self organizes such that it reflects the abstraction. Equation  becomes,rk2k3k

The ratio as a whole reflects the same geometric sequence as the numerator , it encodes an
increasing volume as function of the radius being doubled in a geometric progression
the only difference is that the sequence lags two iterations behind. And in fact, both expressions
(numerator and ratio overall) will proof to be sequences of increasing surface area:
Making sense of zeta
It makes sense to designate surface area as the primary expression of the zeta function because it is
present as common ratio of the combined expression in numerator and denominator. Apparently the
zeta function expresses a continuous increment in surface area that does not ‘enclose’ a volume, but
IS the volume.
Figure 2.01 SA as a Volume
A graphical impression of a volume resulting from wrapped surface area. Fact is that in the geometric
sequences any sense of continuous curvature is absent. It is the structure of the numerator and
denominator of  that allows us to envision the trace of a spherical object shaped like a 3d
spiral of surface area (fig. volume mbrane monosheet). It seems that the abstract sum exposes
aspects that are spatial in nature, as if the algorithm  actually traces some 3d object while
traversing the infinite series. The proposed hypothesis is the exact opposite such that the 3d structural
aspects observed in nature, the tangible spatial aspects of &#x27;space&#x27;, might be merely an illusion. This
presumed illusory aspect of 3-dimensional spatial aspect is also recognized in the holographic
principle. [Wikipedia: Real numbers and topological properties][5] The rationals are a dense subset of
the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is
that rational numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions as regular continued fractions. In
light of the topological argument, sec based on the sum of reciprocal squares of the natural numbers,
one would not suspect such a sum to produce anything else but a rational value. Continuity as
property of the Real numbers will be exposed as an illusion caused by topological projection, whereby
the sets  and  are merely distinguished by choice of perspective.,,,,...→ ,,,1,2,4,8,...()1

Q R
Contrasting discrete and continuous aspects
The spatial ratio, (equation ) is discrete, consists of rational values which describe scale
invariant ratios. This structure of scale invariant ratios can be interpreted in terms of spherical
geometry. The structure  as limit of the product , indicates that  refers to
an end volume, and that  refers to  the surface area of this volume . This leaves the
impression that the infinite product of the zeta function represents a complete cycle during which
some volume expands by doubling of its radius, from the first term of the infinite series to the last.
Abstract concepts do not have spatial properties nor do they exhibit dynamic behavior in any physical
sense, so what does &#x27;some volume expands by doubling of its radius&#x27; in essence mean? Postulated is
an abstract spatial object under-laying the nature of numbers. This abstraction exposes spherical
properties like radius, circumference and volume detached from any apparent physical context
Detached from spatial dimensions
The detachment from spatial dimensions is clear because the zeta algorithm does not operate on a
data set obtained from a spatial context, be it sampled from nature or derived from some abstract
model of nature. All that is derived from the function value  are patterns that match
geometric sequences and a apparently Real number function value that might be a infinitely close
rational approximation. The conjecture is that discrete accumulation, be it abstract numerically or
wave/particle like as observed in physics, follows a first principle that might be described as &#x27;pre-
mathematical&#x27;. This first principle forces both numerical abstract models and/or physical reality to
emerge such that the structure of both systems are clearly of common descent but not necessarily
contingent on each other. In other words, this first principle must be self evidently present in abstract
numerical models and physical systems such that it has explanatory power for the effectiveness of
mathematics in modeling natural systems, or reversely, the ability to gain new mathematical insight
from observing nature.
Ab initio principle
The hypothesized &#x27;pre-mathematical&#x27; first principle, as will be presented, follows from the theory of
convex sets and is surprisingly simple to recognize in context of physical reality. It is in the physical
implementation that we find the bridge to the Riemann zeta function and the proof for the conjecture
&#x27;all zeros have real part one half&#x27;. This means that a model for the distribution of the zeta zeros and
the source for particle repulsion will be known from first principle and likewise rooted in basic
mathematical principles. As stated in chapter 1, we will not use complex analysis, we will arrive at the
zeta zeros from another angle. For this we build a new analytic tool and start by contrasting the
mathematical abstraction of the sum of reciprocal squares and its supposed spatial attributes against
spatial attributes of spherical geometry as observed in natural systems.

somevalue(02.18)
The zeta function value seems to indicate the inflation of a volume with respect to an initial volume. It
does so because it has in it the radius for the successive cycle of inflation. Clearly any numerical
quantity derived from appropriate context can be interpreted to represent length, area, volume, time,
any applicable dimensional quality. Such a context is for the zeta function, an infinite product over the
primes (all primes) or infinite sum over the natural numbers (all numbers) not obvious at all. Why do
we find a relation to the inverse square law and spherical geometry? Numerically a ‘volume’ has
inflated, and the process expresses this in a value that encodes a spatial ratio (see equation ).
The ratio  appears to be based on a surface area  and must thus be proportional to the volume it
encloses. The first aspect to take note of is that the zeta function expresses no elements of spherical
geometry, i.e. Only rational numerical values, line segments if you will, are the sole constituents of the
function value. Because spatial aspects, if at all present, do not follow from the zeta algorithm, care
has to be taken not to inadvertently introduce spatial aspects. How to prevent erroneous introduction
of those aspects?
Consider the following formulas
In each case the spatial aspect is represented by either raising the radius to a power, or reversely,
taking the  of the value  for volume or  for surface area. The factors ()
and  represent the curvature detached from spatial aspects. The subject of investigation is why
the Real number value of  follows from, in essence, a rational context. We do assume
however that spatial attributes like volume,surface and length are illusory aspects of reality. So when
contrasting the apparent spatial aspects of the sum of reciprocal squares we have to take care not to
unwittingly introduce spatial aspects like  when the assumption is there are no
analogues to tangible spatial aspects represented in the sum of reciprocal squares.
Not from a spatial context or abstraction thereof
For instance if we cube a radius we define a volume, and reversely, if we apply the formula
 the assumption is that  represents a volume, be it derived from some model with
spatial properties, or from measurements obtained from some spatial context. The function
 represents neither the former nor the latter, therefor, to take a cube root in this context,
for instance , is in essence an operation that presupposes volume, and thus introduces a
spatial context in the results. A context not present in the zeta function algorithm to begin with.
Therefore the correct action is to obtain the initial- and end-radius conform the formula ,
but omit reducing spatial aspects as if they represent volume. This simply means to stop short of
reducing the cubic root in order to obtain the regular 1-dimensional radius, but in stead work with the
cubed value as is: . Simply put, if the question “who or what cubed that value?”, can not be
answered, then assume it is not cubed at all, after all, the function  is nothing more then a
sum/product of rational values which as such has no relation to any spatial context. The cubed radius02.09

 can be approached alternatively and has a deep connection to . This
connection leads to a two dimensional model that, like holographic models, causes an
illusion/projection of three dimensional space. To confirm this conjecture of the illusory aspect of
spatial properties, a model is needed to explain how it is that we experience a 3 dimensional reality.
Spherical scale-invariant proportion
Assuming the zeta function encodes a scale-invariant proportion of surface area (SA), a rather naive
approach provides more insight. Mapping any value for  to a circumference, surface area
or for instance cubic value, can be achieved by using the appropriate numerator and retain
proportionality in the denominator, . A mapping of zeta for  gives
Mapping to a circumference
Scaling to  a circumference over a radius. Calculate the (s-1) derivative of the numerator
and preserve proportionality with respect to that derivative in the denominator. e.g. for  where
s=2, it takes the first derivative to map  to : :
Obviously the function value for  must be known in order to feed back in this formula, however, it
is the mapping that will provide insight into the inner structure of the zeta function.
This pattern will hold for all ‘s’. Because &#x27;s&#x27; is the exponent of the numerator, the algorithm can be
generalized for all ‘s’ by application of the factorial function. For s=5,
The (s-1) derivative of  translates to  and allows for the following closed formula for all s:
And because this is a ratio, proceed by simplifying to the first derivative of  by multiplying the
ratio with 2 over ‘s’ factorial, and map all  to the radius :=r3V
