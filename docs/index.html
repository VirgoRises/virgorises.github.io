    <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Ancient engeneers set up a transmission station, and it is still transmitting messages 4474 years after crancking it up.</p>
    
    <p>An unknown culture prior to 2450 BCE was in possession of a detailed database of climate events stretching back to at least 18000 BCE (stretching back15500 years before 2450 BCE).</p>

<p>Yes, I thought so. However you want to know. I need you for review and bash this hypothesis mercilessly.</p>

    <p>Science aims to achieve the maximally satisfactory effect with minimal effort, materials, or steps.
The law of parsimony: `It is pointless to do with more what can be done with fewer`.</p>

<p>Because it is in essense an ICT claim, I figured; Why not provide you with some tools to aid you in your quest for falsification?</p>
<p>I admit to be somewhat rusty, dated maybe, in my programming skills. Rest assured that all calculations are basic, and easy to replicate with scientific calculator, pencil, straigth edge, and printouts of graphs to draw on.</p>

    <p>I am an expert in nothing. So 'peer review' is a goner.While you take a rest from trampeling, hear my muffled voice raising from beneath your feet. I will thank you for your efford nonetheless. Enjoy yourself bashing my inpecable logic reasoning? Put some bread in my jar for the shear joy of it. Blue buttons are always somewhere close by to accept your kind donations.</p>
