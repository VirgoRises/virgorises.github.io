    <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Ancient engineers set up a radio station. It is still sending messages 4474 years after cranking it up.</p>
    
    <p>An unknown culture prior to 2450 BCE possessed a detailed database of climate events stretching back to at least 18000 BCE (stretching back15500 years before 2450 BCE).</p>

<p>Yes, I thought so. However, you want to know. I need you to review and bash this hypothesis mercilessly.</p>

    <p>Science aims to achieve the maximally satisfactory effect with minimal effort, materials, or steps.
The law of parsimony: ‘It is pointless to do with more what can be done with fewer’.</p>

<p>Because it is an ICT claim, I figured; Why not provide you with some tools to aid you in your quest for falsification?</p>
<p>It is enlightening to see the algorithm work, being able to play with it. But you need to verify. Make sure you do not ‘believe’ the program; All calculations are basic, and easy to replicate with scientific calculator, pencil, straightedge, and printouts of graphs to draw on. It is satisfying to measure out and draw the occasional line.</p>

    <p>I am an expert in nothing. So ‘peer review’ is a goner. Next best thing, though, is energetic ‘sneer review’. Lest you pause from trampling my life’s work, you may hear a muffled voice raising from beneath your feet. It will thank you for your effort. The dust it whirls up might draw a more favorable crowd. That been said; If you enjoy yourself bashing my impeccable logic reasoning? Why not put some bread in my jar for the sheer joy of that? I sprinkled blue buttons over the content, and always available to accept your kind donations.</p>
