Template

Version 2.1 \- May 17, 2013

**Using This Template**

This and other PDM tools are available. All Sections are required to be addressed, however if a section or subsection is not needed, that section/subsection of the document can be marked as Not Applicable but as explanation must be provided as to why it does not apply. Please also reference the **Lessons Learned** section in the Appendix for additional information that may assist.

To create a deliverable from this template:

1. Delete the template title page (previous page) and this page.  
2. Replace \[bracketed text\] on the cover page (next page) with your project and agency information.  
3. Replace \[bracketed text\] in the tool header area at the top of Page i (Contents page) with the same project and agency information as on the cover page.  
     
   Note: Please do not remove or modify content in the footer area.  
     
4. Complete the entire template. Each section contains abbreviated instructions, shown in italics, and a content area. The content area is marked with a placeholder symbol () or with a table. Relevant text from other project deliverable may be pasted into content areas.

   Note: Please do not remove the italicized instructions.

5. Update the table of contents by right-clicking and selecting “Update Field,” then “Update entire table.”

# **Section 1   Purpose** {#section-1-purpose}

The purpose of the System Requirements document is to specify the overall system requirements that will govern the development and implementation of the system.  The document will also establish initial security, training, capacity and system architecture requirements, as well as, system acceptance criteria agreed upon be the project sponsor and key stakeholders.

# **Section 2   General System Requirements** {#section-2-general-system-requirements}

## **2.1	Major System Capabilities** {#2.1-major-system-capabilities}

*Specify the major system capabilities in terms of availability, target deployment environment(s), device accessibility, and/or technical capability.*  
*For example:*

- *System must be available on the Internet*  
- *System must be available 24 hours per day*  
- *System must be accessible by mobile devices*  
- *System must be able to accept electronic payments*

## **2.2	Major System Conditions** {#2.2-major-system-conditions}

*Specify major system assumptions and/or constraints (aka conditions). The conditions may limit the options available to the designer/developer. For example:*  
*\- System must use the FDOT Enterprise GIS Framework*  
*\- System must use FDOT Enterprise Document Management System*  
*\- System must interface with Bank of America credit card payment system*

## **2.3	System Interfaces** {#2.3-system-interfaces}

*Describe the dependency and relationship requirements of the system to other enterprise/external systems. Include any interface to a future system or one under development. For clarity, a graphical representation of the interfaces should be used when appropriate.*

## **2.4	System User Characteristics** {#2.4-system-user-characteristics}

*Identify each type of user of the system by function, location, and type of device. Specify the number of users in each group and the nature of their use of the system.*

# **Section 3   Policy and Regulation Requirements** {#section-3-policy-and-regulation-requirements}

*Specify relevant applicable laws, regulations, policies, and standards that will affect the operation and performance of the system, as well as any relevant external regulatory requirements, or constraints imposed by normal business practices.*

## **3.1	Policy Requirements** {#3.1-policy-requirements}

	

## **3.2 	Regulation Requirements** {#3.2-regulation-requirements}

 	

# **Section 4   Security Requirements** {#section-4-security-requirements}

*Specify security requirement for users of the system.*

# **Section 5   Training Requirements** {#section-5-training-requirements}

*Specify Training requirements for the system.*

# **Section 6 Initial Capacity Requirements** {#section-6-initial-capacity-requirements}

*Specify the initial capacity requirements for the system. An initial estimation can be established using current data amounts, planned number of users, and estimated number of transactions.*

1. *Identifies the highest and lowest estimated number of transactions and processing frequency expected usage (including any seasonal peaks) for capacity planning for storage and memory requirements for the application or project. Identifies the highest and lowest estimated number of transactions and processing frequency expected usage (including any seasonal peaks) for capacity planning for storage and memory requirements for the application or project.*

  


# **Section 7   Initial System Architecture** {#section-7-initial-system-architecture}

*Specify the data platform, hardware, software, programming languages, tools and operating system requirements for the application or project.*

2. *Identify any specialized hardware requirements that must be purchased or upgraded prior to development, or in support of the implementation, of the application or project.*  
3. *Identify any specialized software requirements that must be purchased or upgraded prior to development, or in support of the implementation, of the application or project.*  
4. *Identify any programming languages and tools selected for the development of the application or project.*  
5. *Identify any network/operating system or combination of network/operating systems that will be used for the development of the application of project.*

# **Section 8	System Acceptance Criteria** {#section-8-system-acceptance-criteria}

*Specify the general system acceptance criteria specified and agreed upon by the project sponsor and key stakeholders that will be used to accept the final end product. For example:*

* *New system must run in parallel with current production system for x months*  
* *3 years of data must be in system (conversion implied) on day one*

⇒

# **Section 9	Current System Analysis** {#section-9-current-system-analysis}

*If a current system exists, perform analysis on the system and describe how the current system is used by the business. Specify data conversion requirements, relevant data flows, system interfaces to existing systems, reporting capability, etc.*

*⇒*

# **Section 10   References** {#section-10-references}

*Provide a list of all documents and other sources of information referenced in this document and utilized in its development. Include for each the document number, title, date, and responsible office/author.*

| Document No. | Document Title | Date | Author |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

# **Section 11   Glossary** {#section-11-glossary}

*Define of all terms and acronyms required to properly interpret the requirements contained within this document.*

# **Section 12   Document Revision History** {#section-12-document-revision-history}

*Identify revisions to the document starting with initial creation. This section should be updated when an approval is required (i.e. initial creation, change request, new mandated change, etc)*
