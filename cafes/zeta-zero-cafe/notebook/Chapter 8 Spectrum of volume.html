      <pre class="osf" id="osf-1-2">That we arrived at the Archimedes spiral to model the volume of number might be labeled a “historic mathematical coincidence” , being Archimedes discovering the principle cause of buoyancy let us hope the hypothesis will float to the top. But this aside, the patterns of figure 7.22: Stack rhythm in the plane, are drawn on a Cartesian plane representing volume.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-2-2">Table 8.1: Spectrum orthogonal diagonal full cycle, lays out a two dimensional array that extends to 50 rows and columns of $U_{arc}$. The $U_{arc}=7.2\text{°}$ ensures that 50 iterations suffice to complete a full cycle, $\angle U_{arc}\rightarrow\left[7.2\text{°,360°}\right]$.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-3-2">The variable $q\in\mathbb{Q}$ determines the value for which $50^{2}=2500$ data points represent intersecting radii. The radius subdivides into units $\frac{1}{2.5^{2}}=\frac{8}{50}$. The proportion $50^{2}\propto8^{2}$ models the reduction in volume as function of surface area.</pre>
      <pre class="osf" id="osf-4-2">Table 8.1, represents just one out of an infinite number of gradients that represent a 8-fold increase in volume.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-10-2">Where ever the color is absent the angle is 0, progressively the gradient lightens until $\angle n\thinspace mod\thinspace360=0$.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-11-2">The set for q=1 is the baseline. The diagonal from lower right to upper left is the inverse of the orthogonal diagonal, the figure is symmetric over $180\text{°}$. The division in 4 quadrants is presents in all spectra, the least discernible in q=25.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-12-2">There is an evolution visible in Cartesian patterns and patterns of spherical geometry. It seems that at the transition between q=23 and q=25 Descartes wins the fight.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-13-2">This is the core set, A to D, eight transitions $\{1,5\},$$\{5,7\},$$ \{7,11\},$$\{11,13\},$$ \{13,17\},$$\{17,19\},$$ \{19,23\},$$\{23,25\}$, at transition $\frac{6}{9}\rightarrow\{13,17\}$ we find the clearest intermediate pattern between Cartesian and spherical features.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-17-2">The next spectrum for q=49 looks similar to q=1 but is in fact rotated over $45\text{°}$, the diagonals are flipped and the whole configuration remains symmetrical over $180\text{°}$. It is as if we shifted perspective from above to underneath the plane.</pre>
      <pre class="osf" id="osf-18-2">The sets for $q=[I\thinspace55,N85,S115]$ are member of the sets $\left[5,15,35\right]+\left(n\times50\right)$. They project on $55\times7.2\text{°}=$$\angle36\text{°},$$ 85\times7.2\text{°}=$$\angle252\text{°},$$ 115\times7.2\text{°}=$$\angle108\text{°}$</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-20-2">In this we see that a loop occurs connecting two values $\{G41,P91\}$ both along the spiral, and orthogonal to the spiral, through the bulk.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-24-2">The midfields as shown, do not merely connect along the spiral, but share radii with the 9th $\frac{6}{9}block$ further up the stack. The midfield clearly ends a sequence of eighth $\frac{6}{9}block$, but does so scale independent, as chain link in a continuous flow. </pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-25-2">In principle the spiral represents a continuum, but comes prefixed with a rational set of coordinates enforced by units. Those units emerge from integer wavelength resonating in the repository of potential.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-26-2">Mathematics follows nature in the sense that applying mathematics involves counting and manipulating units. Nature does not know math, it necessarily organizes by simple resonance patterns.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-27-2">Figure 8.4: Midfield radial connections, shows radial connections between midfields and start of other $\frac{6}{9}blocks$. All of those radial segments are of length 50 (8) as they connect arcs of the Archimedes spiral.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-28-2">Just like the QGF 2-gon chord, the radius of $50U_{arc}=8$ appears as a linear segment from a previous cycle. In an infinity of steps it completes a $720\text{°}$ cycle passing along the way all conceivable angles with the x-axis, until the radius stretched to x=16 at which point the doubling of radius indicates a completed cycle.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-29-2">In the QGF representation, figure 7.2: Quadrature Geometric Framework, the chord at infinity stands orthogonal to the x-axis after two triangular, or primorial cycles of $45\text{°}$.

The “path along a continuous curve” must be true, because the prime after 23 is 29 and yields $\frac{223092870\times29}{6}=\frac{6469693230}{6}=$$1078282205\rightarrow$$\left\lfloor \frac{1078282205}{25}\right\rfloor =$$n+\frac{1}{5}$.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-45-2">In stead the curve passes the composite $5\times5=25$ along the way, and $\frac{223092870\times25}{6}=\frac{5577321750}{6}=$$929553625\rightarrow$$\left\lfloor \frac{929553625}{25}\right\rfloor =n+0$, indicating a full cycle just occurred.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-46-2">This occurrence of some random integer composite in this sequence of primes can only be meaningful if the intermediate integer 24 has some profound reason *not to appear* on $D_{0}$ as the first next integer in line.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-47-2">Aside from the fact that division by 25 then would not yield an integer result, “24” would <em>know</em> neither <em>decide</em> not to be there because of that fact, as would $2,3,$$4,6,$$8,9,$$10,\dots$ etc, no numerical consciousness present is the best guess. End of fun section.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-48-2">It does have one reason that is not immediately obvious but can be derived from the location of prime 23. Composite 24 appears to belong sequentially to $D_{1}$, above 23, but in fact it claims position at $\frac{24}{6}=4$, the 6th position of block number 4, $\frac{6}{9}block\\,D$ on diagonal $D_{2}$, see fiigure 7.17: Stacking the core.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-49-2">This condition of pattern was postulated in eq. [eq:block-stamp] and the primorial stack nails down the case for the fractal argument and might provide a pathway towards a closed formula for the number and location of primes $\prod\left(n\right)$.</pre>

      <h3>Equilibrium at the bow shock</h3>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-58-2">In “QGF in its natural configuration” there was mention of a “repository of potential” needed for explaining the dynamic behavior we were about to invoke in describing dynamical behavior of the physical implementation of the QGF.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-59-2">At this point we only have a first principle that might account for the emergence of a quantum harmonic oscillator in a complete convex set when the abstraction of the QGF is superimposed on that set. How does one account for a repository of potential that, by observation and experimentation, has real tactile properties, spatial and temporal qualities.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-60-2">It is not sufficient to ‘declare’ such a space into existence and explain its properties in terms of (analogies to) the QGF.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-61-2">Wikipedia: Energy
  In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object.</pre>
      <pre class="osf" id="osf-62-2">Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 meter against a force of 1 newton.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-63-2">Spatial qualities are in fact non existent. The QGF models a dimensionless point that can neither expand nor collapse. But we observe both collapse and expansion at all conceivable scales, so how to account for spatial displacement if, as proposed, there are no such things as spatial qualities in the dimensionless point.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-64-2">There is no mystery here, looking out into the universe is receiving signals from times long gone. The M-brane mono surface stretches out in time, is in a excited state and is in a entropic process similar to a dampened oscillator eventually coming to absolute rest.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-65-2">Yes, “absolute” in clear defiance of the zero point energy attributed to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. The notion of what energy exactly is has a clear explanation under this framework. It is the nature of circumstances that led to the observation that energy evidently is conserved and must be some eternal quantity that can not be destroyed. The repository of potential that we occupy is structured such that observation must led to that conclusion.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-66-2">Then what is it? The Planck constant represents the staccato transfer of potential from unity chord to unity chord at some point of equilibrium as if part of a zone of constant pressure in a shock wave. A continuous gradient of collapsing surface area.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-67-2">It is at the front of a shock wave that we envision the conditions that at first sight energy, and by extension information, is preserved.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-68-2">The universe that we experience to be a spatial realm, expanding in time, is in fact an illusion of ever decreasing ‘surface area’. This surface area that we are part of close to atomic scale, has a cross section that stretches out from the Planck scale to the center of the great voids at universal scale. </pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-69-2">This thin layer of activity is the M-brane mono surface coming to rest by shifting potential from layer to layer, the absolute surface area of the bow shock reduces with the radius, and us observers are integral part of that surface. It is space that apparently expands in relation to that for the observer static surface area, but in fact is just an illusion caused by re-configuring potential.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-70-2">Spatial qualities are an illusion of shifting potential traversing the zero dimensional point. This equilibrium at the bow shock is our universe, a phase transition akin to a boiling kettle of water, a constant $100\text{°}C$ until there is nothing to evaporate left. At which point the bow shock ran its course, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is no more and the potential called “time” reduced to nothing.</pre>

<pre class="osf">The size of the mathematical universe</pre>
<pre class="osf">=====================================</pre>

      <h2>The size of the mathematical universe</h2>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-72-2">Our mathematical universe, given the 8 units on $D_{0}$, has the definite size of $A=8\times8=64$.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-73-2">Not every angle, line or pattern, no matter how appealing, has to have structural meaning in the context of this thesis. Humans are pattern seeking animals by evolutionary necessity and find patterns even where non exist.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-74-2">$D_{0}, D_{1}$ and $D_{2}$ represent areas by triangular projection. In the limit of the triangular projection we are left with a field of dimensionless points, a surface which only structure exists by the linear relation of the natural numbers, a line for short.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-75-2">In this context we are justified to interpret the sum of primes as a linear feature, one that exists on two diagonals. As shown in figure 8.4: Midfield radial connections, there exist a configuration at which those two diagonals line up, and in essence represent the diagonal $\overline{BHD}$ in figure 7.8: Pair correlation proportional chord, at the point of equilibrium. </pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-76-2">In figure 6.3: M-brane mono surface radii group III, line $\overline{AG}=\sqrt{2}$, the longest line in our universe is a diagonal of a square. </pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-77-2">All this we find sufficient corroboration to postulate the size of our (mathematical) universe. But then again, “64” is not that poetic standing there alongside “42”, no cult status just yet. So let us see what 64 has to offer, maybe a slice of history is possible.</pre>

      <pre class="osf" id="osf-78-2">Taken the sum of primes as line $\overline{AG}=\sqrt{2}$, the we find $A_{universe}=\left(\frac{100}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}=5000$, and this provides us with a universal unit of area $A_{1}=\frac{1}{64}5000=78.125$, this all is a bit nondescript until we unlock some beautiful relation and take some time to ponder on the following.</pre>
