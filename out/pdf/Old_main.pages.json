This thesis covers the problem that superseded the Riemann zeta function, ‘the Basel Problem’, called after the Swiss city. At the university of Basel the Bernoulli brothers successively served as professor of mathematics (Jakob, 1687-1705, Johann, 1705-1748). Jakob Bernoulli stated the problem: Find a closed form for the infinite series 1 + 1 2 2 + 1 3 2 + 1 4 2 + 1 5 2 + . . . (1.1) This is the sum of the reciprocal squares of the natural numbers. This series is closely related to the harmonic series for which the Bernoulli brothers found proof for the divergence of the series 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + 1 5 + · · · = ∞ (1.2) The Basel problem, as sum of the reciprocal squares of the natural numbers, is the foundation for what later became inquiry in the distribution of the prime numbers among the natural numbers. After 330 years there are still open questions to be answered . 1.1 Why the Basel problem In essence this paper starts in 1735, the year that Leonhard Euler in st. Pe- tersburg found the answer to the Basel problem, he found the closed (exact) form surprisingly to add up to an irrational number 1 + 1 2 2 + 1 3 2 + 1 4 2 + 1 5 2 + · · · = π 2 6 (1.3) 1"

The funda- mental cause for this can be understood as geometric dilution cor- responding to point-source radiation into three-dimensional space A similar proportional symmetry exists between the result ζ (2) = π 2 6 and the spherical volume enclosed by a surface area SA = π 2 , expressed as twice the radius of such a volume. Let SA = π 2 r sa = √ SA 4 π = √ π 2 4 π = √ π 2 ∼ = 0 . 8862269255 V sa = 4 3 π r 3 sa = 4 3 π ( √ π 2 ) 3 ∼ = 2 . 915569721 V sa ζ (2) = 2 r sa (2.3) 2.2 The structure of Volume over zeta The value volume over zeta is exactly twice the radius calculated for a sphere with SA = π 2 . The function value ζ (2) = π 2 6 represents a ratio which seems to sit in the middle of some dynamic process involving the expansion of a sphere. This becomes clear if we dissect the structure. The ratio V sa ζ (2) = 2 r sa has the form V sa 1 6 SA = 2 × r sa (2.4) Assume that 2 × r sa is proportional to the radius of some next volume, the infinite sum of ζ (2) can be interpreted as the process that completes the inflation (by doubling of radius) from V sa up to V next . The assumed inflation has to start from some initial volume. V sa = 4 3 π ( r sa ) 3 = 4 3 π ( √ π 2 ) 3 ≈ 2 . 915569721 (2.5) This V sa is the volume after completion of ζ (2), therefore a division by 8 gives the initial volume: V init = V sa 8 ≈ 0 . 3644462151 is the supposed start volume. This numerical result is not very informative, a better way is to use scale invariant ratios. The scale invariant ratios V sa itself is the end stage of a previous cycle V init def = 1 is the initial volume"

THE STRUCTURE OF VOLUME OVER ZETA 7 Which makes V sa = 8 × V init = 8, the end-stage of ζ (2), thus relabel for clarity, V sa → V end V end is the stage before the next volume, therefore V next = 8 × V end = 64 The interpretation of volume over zeta in light of the scale invariant ra- tios indicates a (snapshot of a) dynamic structure of 3 consecutive stages of inflation. Stages V end and r end represent the value for the middle volume that is reached at completion of the zeta function. V init = 1 → V end = 8 → V next = 64 r init = 1 → r end = 2 → r next = 4 (2.6) To emphasize: r end = 2, refers to twice the radius associated with V end , and such a radius cannot belong to V end in the regular sense . This means that V init by method of completing the pattern must have a relative radius of r init = 1 2 , because under this scheme volume over zeta returns twice the relative radius of the sphere. Now by logic of ratio, sa end = V end (= 8) r end (= 2) = 4 (2.7) The surface area of a sphere grows with a factor 4 by doubling the radius. Thus the volume of the current iteration, V end divided by the radius of the consecutive volume r end , which is in fact the double radius found with V end , gives the proportional multiplication factor of surface area by doubling of radius. Observe that it simultaneously represents a growth factor of 4 , ass well the scale invariant size of the current surface area. sa init = 1 → sa end = 4 → sa next = 16 (2.8) In equation 2.8, sa end = 4 does refer to the surface area of the second iter- ation., e.g. { 1 , 4 , 16 , 64 } , but in equation 2.7, sa end = 4, in context of the ratio where 2 r sa refers to the consecutive volume, refers to the constant rate of growth of surface area between iterations . This aspect of a common ratio is also present for volume and radius, however, equation 2.7 as a ratio, will proof to be crucial. The ratio V end r end = 4 is a constant value by necessity in this scheme, as we will see shortly. V init ( V end r end ) = 1 4 (2.9)"

      "text": "8 CHAPTER 2. THE SPATIAL ASPECT OF ZETA The intimate relation (eq. 2.9) between the numerator and denominator begs for an explanation. Taken in unison they both encode for spherical as- pects, but do so following different sequences involving the presumed spatial properties. A seemingly three dimensional structure hovers just below the surface of the zeta function. However, it concerns an abstract object, abstract ob- jects do not take up space in a physical sense. And although clear spatial aspects are identified, there are no spatial aspects discernible in the infinite sum/product of the zeta function itself, nor is there any connection with 3-dimensional attributes in the zeta algorithm. This lack of spatial properties might point to the outline of an abstract mathematical object that can be identified as a first principle under-laying the emergence of physical three dimensional structure. 2.3 Geometric progression Nothing in the abstraction of the zeta function indicates a connection to spherical geometry. The zeta function arrives at the same answer by two distinct procedures, the additive sum formula eq.1.1 and the multiplicative product formula eq. 1.5. At the core we find arithmetic and geometric sequences that outline spherical attributes interwoven in the set of rational numbers Q . Such abstract sequences by themselves,however, are not sufficient to cause/project spherical attributes in physical sense. Wikipedia In mathematics, a geometric progression, also known as a geometric sequence, is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with com- mon ratio 3. Similarly 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, ... is a geometric sequence with common ratio 1/2. Examples of a geometric sequence are powers r k of a fixed number r, such as 2 k and 3 k . The general form of a geometric sequence is { a, ar, ar 2 , ar 3 , ar 4 , . . . } where r 6 = 0 is the common ratio and a is a scale factor, equal to the sequence’s start value. 2.3.1 Progression and common ratio’s The numerator of the general pattern (see equation 2.10), is simply expressed starting at init vol #0 = 1 2 and then progresses with a common ratio of 2."

GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION 9 init vol #0 = 1 2 ( v =1 0 . 25 ) , volume #1 = 1 ( v =8 2 ) , volume #2 = 2 ( v =64 16 ) , volume #3 = 4 ( v =512 128 ) (2.10) Thus encoding an increasing volume as function of a doubling radius in a geometric progression with a common ratio 2, { ( V 0 = 1 2 ) , ( V 1 = 1) , ( V 2 = 2) , ( V 3 = 4) , ... } (2.11) This given the context, is indeed a sequence to encode for an expanding sphere, but void of proper context it is an arbitrary, unwarranted, choice and should just be interpreted as some linear sequence. The second part expressed in the denominator, is more specific and gives clues how to interpret the ratio as a whole. The value of the denominator is itself a ratio 1 2 ( v =1 0 . 25 = 4 ) , 1 ( v =8 2 = 4 ) , 2 ( v =64 16 = 4 ) , 4 ( v =512 128 = 4 ) (2.12) Here the numerator starts at v = 1 and progresses with a common ratio of 8, { 1 , 8 , 64 , 512 , . . . } . Note that this sequence is encoded as an 8-fold increase of volume proportional to a doubling of the radius. Yet another linear expres- sion to encode for an expanding sphere given the context in which it is found. In the denominator the value represents 1 4 of the volume in the numerator. This simple property makes that whole ratio of the denominator for each instance equal to 4, and thus encodes a static measure of surface area. And this is however simple, just as it should be, because found is a spatial ratio that encodes a ratio of volume over surface area at the completion of the infinite sum/product ζ (2), S ratio = V init = 1 ( V end =8 r end 3=2 ) = 1 4 (2.13) This is the pattern recognized in the inverse square law and the geometric progression of surface area by a common factor of 4, for each consecutive dou- bling of radius. And yes, this V end =1 SA end =4 only holds for the infinite sum/product ζ (2) = π 2 6 . The challenge is therefore to provide a natural mechanism which independent of the abstraction, can be shown to necessarily emerge from some identifiable first condition and necessarily self organizes such that it reflects the abstraction. Equation 2.12 becomes, ( 1 2 ) 4 , 1 4 , 2 4 , 4 4 , ... → 1 8 , 1 4 , 1 2 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , ... (2.14)"

And in fact, both expressions (numerator and ratio overall) will proof to be sequences of increasing surface area: { common ratio = 4 } × { 1 (8) , 1 (4) , 1 (2) , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , ... } = sequence V init { 1 2 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , ... } (2.16) 2.4 Making sense of zeta It makes sense to designate surface area as the primary expression of the zeta function because it is present as common ratio of the combined expression in numerator and denominator. Apparently the zeta function expresses a continuous increment in surface area that does not ‘enclose’ a volume, but IS the volume. Figure 2.1: SA as a Volume Fact is that in the geometric sequences any sense of continuous curvature is absent. It is the structure of the numerator and denominator of SA ratio = V init = 1 ( V end =8 r end 3=2 ) = 1 4 that allows us to envision the trace of a spherical object shaped like a 3d spiral of surface area (fig. 2.1).

The proposed hypothesis is the exact opposite such that the 3d structural aspects observed in nature, the tangible spatial aspects of ’space’, might be merely an illusion. This presumed illusory aspect of 3-dimensional spatial aspect is also recognized in the holographic principle 2 . Once again the topological argument: Wikipedia: Real numbers and topological properties The rationals are a dense subset of the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. ... The rationals are a dense subset of the real numbers: every real number has rational numbers arbitrarily close to it. A related property is that rational numbers are the only numbers with finite expansions as regular continued fractions In light of the topological argument, sec based on the sum of reciprocal squares of the natural numbers, one would not suspect such a sum to produce anything else but a rational value. Continuity as property of the Real num- bers will be exposed as an illusion caused by topological projection, whereby the sets Q and R are merely distinguished by choice of perspective. 2.4.1 Contrasting discrete and continuous aspects spatial ratio → ( initial volume ) ( end volume end radius ) → V init = 1 ( V end =8) r end =2 → 1 4 (2.17) The spatial ratio, (equation 2.17) is discrete, consists of rational values which describe scale invariant ratios. This structure of scale invariant ratios can be interpreted in terms of spherical geometry. The structure V sa ζ (2) ≡ 2 r sa as limit of the product ζ (2) = π 2 6 , indicates that V sa refers to an end volume, and that π 2 6 refers to 1 6 the surface area of this volume sa = π 2 . This leaves the impression that the infinite product of the zeta function represents a complete cycle during which some volume expands by doubling of its radius, from the first term of the infinite series to the last. Abstract concepts do not have spatial properties nor do they exhibit dy- namic behavior in any physical sense, so what does ’ some volume expands by doubling of its radius ’ in essence mean?

The detachment from spatial dimensions is clear because the zeta algorithm does not operate on a data set obtained from a spatial context, be it sampled from nature or derived from some abstract model of nature. All that is derived from the function value ζ (2) = π 2 6 are patterns that match geometric sequences and a apparently Real number function value that might be a infinitely close rational approximation. The conjecture is that discrete accumulation, be it abstract numerically or wave/particle like as observed in physics, follows a first principle that might be described as ’pre-mathematical’. This first principle forces both numerical abstract models and/or physical reality to emerge such that the structure of both systems are clearly of common descent but not necessarily contingent on each other. In other words, this first principle must be self evidently present in ab- stract numerical models and physical systems such that it has explanatory power for the effectiveness of mathematics in modeling natural systems, or reversely, the ability to gain new mathematical insight from observing nature. The hypothesized ’pre-mathematical’ first principle, as will be presented, follows from the theory of convex sets and is surprisingly simple to recognize in context of physical reality. It is in the physical implementation that we find the bridge to the Riemann zeta function and the proof for the conjecture ’all zeros have real part one half’. This means that a model for the distribution of the zeta zeros and the source for particle repulsion will be known from first principle and likewise rooted in basic mathematical principles. As stated in chapter 1, we will not use complex analysis, we will arrive at the zeta zeros from another angle. For this build a new analytic tool and start by contrasting the mathematical abstraction of the sum of reciprocal squares and its supposed spatial attributes against spatial attributes of spherical geometry as observed in natural systems. 2.4.2 From ‘abstract spatial’ to ‘observed continuity’ ζ ( s ) = ∞ ∏ p ( 1 − p − s ) − 1 = 1 1 − 1 2 2 × 1 1 − 1 3 2 × 1 1 − 1 5 2 × ... = 4 3 × 9 8 × 25 24 × ... = π 2 6 → surf ace area some value (2.18) The zeta function value seems to indicate the inflation of a volume with respect to an initial volume. It does so because it has in it the radius for the successive cycle of inflation. Clearly any numerical quantity derived from appropriate context can be interpreted to represent length, area, volume,"

Such a context is for the zeta function, an infinite product over the primes (all primes) or infinite sum over the natural numbers (all numbers) not obvious at all . Why do we find a relation to the inverse square law and spherical geome- try? Numerically a ‘volume’ has inflated, and the process expresses this in a value that encodes a spatial ratio (see equation 2.17). The ratio π 2 6 appears to be based on a surface area π 2 and must thus be proportional to the volume it encloses. The first aspect to take note of is that the zeta function expresses no elements of spherical geometry, i.e. Only rational numerical values, line segments if you will, are the sole constituents of the function value. Because spatial aspects, if at all present, do not follow from the zeta algorithm, care has to be taken not to inadvertently introduce spatial aspects. How to prevent erroneous introduction of those aspects? Consider the following formulas V = 4 3 πr 3 yields the volume of a sphere r = 3 √ V ( 4 3 π ) yields the radius from a given volume. SA = 4 πr 2 yields the surface area of a sphere r = √ SA 4 π yields the radius from a given surface area In each case the spatial aspect is represented by either raising the radius to a power, or reversely, taking the n th root of the value r 3 = V ( 4 3 π ) for volume or r 2 = SA 4 π for surface area. The factors ( 4 3 π ) and (4 π ) represent the curvature detached from spatial aspects. As the subject of investigation is why the Real number value of ζ (2) = π 2 6 follows from, in essence, a rational context. We do assume however that spatial attributes like volume,surface and length are illusory aspects of reality. So when contrasting the apparent spatial aspects of the sum of reciprocal squares we have to take care not to unwittingly introduce spatial aspects like V = l × h × w when the assumption is there are no analogues to tangible spatial aspects represented in the sum of reciprocal squares. For instance if we cube a radius we define a volume, and reversely, if we apply the formula r = 3 √ V ( 4 3 π ) the assumption is that | 4 3 πr 3 | represents a volume, be it derived from some model with spatial properties, or from measurements obtained from some spatial context. The function ζ (2) = π 2 6 represents neither the former nor the latter, therefor, to take a cube root in this context, for instance r = 3 √ x , is in essence an operation that presupposes volume , and thus introduces a spatial context in the results . A context not present in the zeta function algorithm to begin with. Therefore the correct action is to obtain the initial- and end-radius conform the formula r = 3 √ V ( 4 3 π ) ,"

This simply means to stop short of reducing the cubic root in order to obtain the regular 1-dimensional radius, but in stead work with the cubed value as is: r 3 = V ( 4 3 π ) . Simply put, if the question “who or what cubed that value?”, can not be answered, then assume it is not cubed at all, after all, the function ζ (2) is nothing more then a sum/product of rational values which as such has no relation to any spatial context. The cubed radius r 3 = V ( 4 3 π ) can be approached alternatively and has a deep connection to V sa ζ (2) = 2 r sa . This connection leads to a two dimensional model that, like holographic models, causes an illusion/projection of three dimensional space. To confirm this conjecture of the illusory aspect of spatial properties a model is needed to explain how it is that we experience a 3 dimensional reality. 2.5 Spherical scale-invariant proportion Assuming the zeta function encodes a scale-invariant proportion of surface area (SA), a rather naive approach provides more insight. Mapping any value for ζ ( s ) = π s x to a circumference, surface area or for instance cubic value, can be achieved by using the appropriate numerator and retain proportionality in the denominator, π s π s ζ (2) − 1 > = 1. A mapping of zeta for π 2 gives ζ (2) = π 2 6 , ζ (3) = π 2 8 . 210596 ... , ζ (4) = π 2 9 . 118906528 ... (2.19) 2.5.1 Mapping to a circumference Scaling to ζ (2) = 2 π x a circumference over a radius. Calculate the (s-1) derivative of the numerator and preserve proportionality with respect to that derivative in the denominator. e.g. for ζ (2) where s=2, it takes the first derivative to map π 2 to 2 π 1 : f ( π ) = π 2 → f ′ ( π ) = 2 π : ζ ′ (2) = 2 π (2 π ) ( π 2 6 ) − 1 = 2 π 3 . 819718634 = 2 π ( 24 2 π ) → circumf erence radius (2.20) Obviously the function value for ζ (2) must be known in order to feed back in this formula, however, it is the mapping that will provide insight into the"

The total affected area can be expressed in relation to:  The projection plane: T n =3 → A \u0003 = 6 4 × 9 = 6 36 = 1 6  The triangular plane: T n =3 → A ∆ = 6 9 4.4.1 Proportion above hypotenuse Except for the limiting case lim n →∞ , there is a portion of the affected area that projects above the hypotenuse.

This leaves no affected area remaining above the hypotenuse of quadrant III, for a total of A ∆ = 1 2 \u0019 A \u0003 = A ∆ A \u0003 = 1 8 . In this configuration the hypotenuse of the affected area will be c = 1 2 √ 2 ∝ π 2 √ 2. 4.5 Triangular projection to Surface Area The area projected by square area units in the triangular plane A ∆ , can also be represented by a continuous triangular section of the projection plane A \u0003 as a whole with right angle sides (note the emphasis) a = b = √ 2 A ∆ . Such a projection for the triangular numbers will exceed the bounds of quad- rant III for all triangular numbers with exception for the limiting case which projects on the diagonal of quadrant III, see fig.4.4. The hypotenuse of Area → T n =3 = 6 has length: c n =3 = √ 2 × Area × √ 2 = √ 24. The hypotenuse at T n =3 sections off exactly the affected area as shown in the triangular projection 1 6 = 1 8 + 1 24 . In essence providing a continuous repre- sentation of the discrete triangular projection. By this procedure both T n =3 and ζ (2) = π 2 6 are mapped to the projection plane. The emphasis on “ with right angled sides ” has a purpose, a triangle number counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle and not in a right sided triangle."

The interpretation of A \u0003 = 6 9 π 2 is that it indicates a previous cycle of ζ (2) = π 2 6 when the ratio affected cells for the triangular plane reached A ∆ = 6 9 . The fraction 6 9 is associated with the affected area of the triangular plane A ∆ in the third quadrant of the projection plane A \u0003 resulting from ζ (2) = π 2 6 , and here we find this configuration superimposed on the projection plane A \u0003 = 6 9 π 2 as if it is the triangular plane. At ζ (1) the affected area of the projection plane A \u0003 is 6 9 , mirroring the triangular plane A ∆ at ζ (2). The value ζ (2) = π 2 6 , indicates that both projection plane and triangular plane are projections of the same area π 2 at two distinct moments of some recursive process .

Those values can- not be mapped as triangular number grid in quadrant III, however, the values can be mapped as affected area in the mathematical universe of A \u0003 . In table 4.1, page 31 we find that the value for ζ (2) coincides with n = 3 → a = √ 2 × 1 6 and a proportional SA = π 2 .

In this sense the triangular numbers pro- jected onto the projection plane A \u0003 can be interpreted as a scale invariant snapshot of any stage in hypothesized state of continuous collapse . Which, of course, implies that for this to be true, also the natural numbers n ∈ N must be interpreted as a set of labels attached to relative positions on a gliding scale. For now we assume this dynamical aspect as a given, and proceed under the assumption that this geometric model represents a phase shift in the math- ematical universe that, during hypothesized collapse, geometrically fixates the relative positions of those labels."

We find values for SA ∝ 6 9 × π 2 , SA = 1 × π 2 , and SA ∝ π 2 6 × π 2 (see table 4.2, page 32). As found previously, the scale factor ( A \u0003 A ∆ ) = 4 is key because the triangular plane, or rather quadrant III it projects in, is clearly the scale invariant continuation of the projection plane A \u0003 . We see that with respect to scale, ( A \u0003 A ∆ ) × π 2 6 ∝ 6 9 π 2 . The apparent increment in surface area from π 2 to π 2 6 × π 2 between s = 2 and s = ∞ is, however, a dynamical interpretation imposed on what essentially is a mathematical abstraction, so there must be some real world context in which proposed phase shift can be identified as part of some dynamical process in space/time reality. In chapter 8 a proposal to explain the nature of this phase shift will be formulated, and a relation will be identified between the conservation laws, the nature of vacuum energy and the cosmological constant Λ. First identify the static numerical pattern that seems to occurs at the point of equilibrium for the ratio affected area:  For the projection plane A \u0003 , numerator and denominator are A \u0003 → 6 n 6  For the triangular plane A ∆ , numerator and denominator are A ∆ → 6 n +1 9 Thus the increase of the affected area progresses in a 1 : 4 ratio (see eq. 2.17, page 11), 6 0 = 1 6 A \u0003 → 6 1 = 6 9 A ∆ 6 1 = 6 6 A \u0003 → 6 2 = 36 9 A ∆ (4.6) which indicates the total affected area of A ∆ must be 6 6 A \u0003 = 1 A \u0003 or corrected for scale in-variance A ∆ A \u0003 A \u0003 = 1 4 A \u0003 = A ∆ for each iteration.

In the limit lim n →∞ → T n → # n ∈ N the right angled sides contain each # n ∈ N , but also the hypotenuse c = # n ∈ N (see subsection 4.5, Triangular projection to surface area). All 3 sides count # n ∈ N elements of equal area. Application of the multiplication factor √ 2 to account for “absolute size” measured over the 45 ◦ hypotenuse makes no sense, this because in the limit both the straight angled sides and the hypotenuse consist of an equal number of dimensionless points and therefor represent lines of equal length, i.e. forming a distorted equilateral triangle.

The associated radius for the sphere is r x = r q √ p ∆( # ) − 1 = 1 . 136630193 and yields a surface area of SA = 4 π ( r x ) 2 = π 2 ( π 2 6 ) (see table 4.2). A factor π 2 6 bigger than our universe, the projection plane. Because some collapsing surface area is assumed, the scale factor A ∆ A \u0003 = 1 4 needs to be observed. The algorithm produces for s=1, ζ (1) = π 2 4 → SA = 6 9 π 2 = 4 × π 2 6 . For s=2, ζ (2) = π 2 6 → SA = π 2 = 4 × π 2 4 . This means that the initial configuration of ζ (1) is also the final configura- tion of ζ (2), this is sufficient to describe the recursion in terms of the phase shift with exclusion of the values for s > 2. Likewise the result for ζ ( ∞ ) → SA = π 2 6 ( π 2 ) is a factor 4 to big. Therefore SA = 1 4 ( π 2 ( π 2 6 )) scales to the universe. Plugging in this value produces a surface area SA = 1 4 × ( π 2 ( π 2 6 )) π 2 = π 2 24 . This is a significant result because 3 × 1 72 = 1 24 is exact the area that exceeds the hypotenuse of the triangular plane for ζ (2), see figure 4.8, page 38. The hypotenuse of the triangular plane is off course the limit lim n →∞ T n .

Herein we find a profound key to the solution, one that is of significance in connecting the dots between ζ (2) and physics. The transition π 2 → π 2 8 can be interpreted as a function of volume but ζ (2) is expressed as a function of (surface) area. At the function value of ζ (2) a unique point of equilibrium occurs that sits at the source of the emergence of Planck’s constant h = 6 . 62607015 × 10 − 34 J.s. . The projection plane exposes a point of equilibrium between volume and surface area, ζ (2), at which Surface Area and Volume can be recognized as expressions of one underlying principle. Table 4.3 ’The base of Planck’s constant’, gives a break down for the formulae of surface area and volume.

The equilibrium follows from the fractal argument for zeta. 4.11 The fractal argument for zeta Figure 4.9 on page 41 depicts a recursive regression of the triangular plane, quadrant III, as found in the configuration for ζ (1) → SA ∝ 6 9 π 2 . The fractal iteration in the lower left cell of quadrant III occupies 1 6 of the af- fected area of quadrant III. If we assume the recursive product ∏ n ζ (2) n = { 1 , 1 6 , 1 36 , 1 216 , 1 1296 , . . . } then for each iteration we find that the ratio affected area ζ (2) = π 2 6 must have the scale invariant ratio SA = π 2 , i.e. represent the universe of the projection plane A \u0003 as a whole.

Further, the point of origin for both triangles is B. It is easy to see that by decreasing segment CE , labeled ∆ ζ (2), will map both triangles in one to one correspondence. We recognize the chord BC in a somewhat peculiar place for a hexagonal chord in figure 5.2, page 46, namely it is the chord h init between r q = √ 2 − 1 and a = √ 2 − 1 that corresponds with the hypotenuse in figure 4.6, page 34, at the extend of ζ (1). This indicates that triangle ∠ ABC is the end phase of a cycle, in this model the hypotenuse at ζ (1) indicates a 4-fold decrement in surface area. The chord BE on the other hand does also associate with the end of a cycle, it is the limit of the trian- gular cycle. See n = ∞ in table 4.1, page 31. The conclusion must be that both BC and BE are in fact one and the same, they stand back to back, occupy the same space, are merely separated by choice of perspective. One way of looking at it is to assume that both triangles 4 ABC and 4 DBC are conjoined along their chords and model a spherical triangle as depicted in figure 5.7, page 54. Together they can be envisioned to form 4 A ′ B ′ C ′ , but will encompass in fact the entire surface area because of the scale invariant property of volume. This in turn will clarify again the surface area vs volume equilibrium as shown in figure 4.9, page 41.

In the limit lim n →∞ T n → a = √ 2 A consists of all natural numbers counting of all triangular numbers. This is also the case for the hypotenuse c which has exactly as many members as the sides a and b by nature of their arrangement. This makes all sides of the triangle in count of represented numbers equally sized. We identified chords BC and BE as two expressions of one and the same chord (fig. 5.6) and the process in which segment CE decreases until in the limit both triangles are in a one to one correspondence.

At any given moment the universe is in a state where the chords c 1 and c ℏ are simultaneously observable, measurable, but can only be recognized in there distinct identity as either Cartesian or part of spherical geometry. In this figure the spherical identity must be from chord c ℏ = √ 5 2 because the length exceeds the maximum length feasible in our math- ematical universe. Conjoining both chords leaves us with two possible con- figurations to represent those chords. United in the hypotenuse c = π √ 2or as the great circle c=2pi, notably the equator, joining two hemispheres.

THE ROOT OF CURVATURE 55 Figure 5.8: M-brane hemisphere mono surface it is the triangular number cycle irrespective of coordinate system, reference frame, that iterates in continuous perpetuity through that cycle. In table 4.1 the cycle starts with a = √ 2 − 1 and ends with a = 1 2 , in what seems a infinity of iterative steps reducing the radius. A perpetual reducing radius produces a surface area that has a unique radial length for each separate surface coordinate it intersects. For regular spherical surfaces this will mean a stack of identical x and y coordinates at each unique radial distance. It is in the continuous regression of surface area that lays a clue hinting at a 2 dimensional surface structure that wraps around a singularity, the surface asymptote found earlier. Figure 5.8 is a model of one hemisphere of such a surface. A Cartesian flat version will be presented. The 2D surface itself stands model for a 3D space spiraling in on itself, any radius intersecting this spiral stands orthogonal on 3D space. M-brane hemisphere mono surface This is a M-brane mono surface with a bulk (void) separating the sur- face layers wrapping over and over. The shape of the surface area of this (two hemisphere) structure, given the bulk infinitely thin and ignoring the subsurface spiral, is approaching that of a sphere. With the singularity as center of this structure, any perfect sphere with fixed radius will cut as a ghost through this surface and only have two (2) coordinates in common with that surface, those are the conjoined surface coordinate(s) { C, E } and the coordinate at the absolute center B, see figure 5.6. 5.5.1 Unity orthogonal to the sphere Taking another look at figure 5.6 it becomes clear what is represented. As CE shortens BE approaches the point at which BC stands orthogonal to the surface of the sphere. As that point is reached then BC and BE share the same radius. There is one aspect to take note of and that is the angle. BC and BE are at that point orthogonal to the surface of the sphere, however, no radius can be orthogonal to the surface of the M-brane.

CHORDS look at it is that because the sphere only intersects the spiral at one point, a continuous decreasing radius will visit each coordinate at the spiral without exception. At certain radial distances it must be the case that the shared coordinate is at the point of equilibrium, see figure 4.9 and table 4.4. In principle the decreasing radius paints the surface of the spiral as a space filling curve, linear and missing no spot. This is what we see expressed in figure 5.6, only from that perspective it is the spheres surface being painted, after all, we are dealing with an infinite set of orthogonal unity chords, see figure 5.2 for h init = h lim = √ 5 2 .

In short, the universe is a complete convex set where all edges between vertices are straight. In spite of that some appear curved because in a Cartesian reference frame the set of points would appear to project outside the universe, hence those sets are perceived as if having properties of spherical geometry. 6.1 The M-brane exposed area In figure 6.4 the regression is depicted as successive squares of the radii. Each iterative step is depicted as a full triangular cycle of 45 ◦ → √ 2 − 1 × √ 2 = 1 2 . A partition of the area has no overlap with previous and subsequent areas, those are indicated A through E, measure 1 4 of the current iteration and 1 2 of the subsequent iteration. By symmetry it takes two iterations ( AC → AB ) ∝ 2 × 45 ◦ = 90 ◦ reach a 4-fold reduction in area.

Area 4 AED = 9 60 and therefore remains Area \u0003 EBCD = 1 60 . The coordinates for point D are D x = cos ( tan − 1 ( 1 3 )) = ( √ T h ) − 1 and D y = sin ( tan − 1 ( 1 3 )) = ( √ 10 ) − 1 yielding an area Area 4 AED = 9 60 = 0 . 15 → 360 24 = 15. The sum of areas 4 AED + \u0003 EBCD = 4 ABC = 1 6 is equivalent to 9 60 × T h = 1 6 .

This final value 10 90 = T h is as found in figure 4.9 where the value indicates the repetition of the projection plane. The proportionality is convenient.

To complicate matters further, knowing and following algorithms demand agency. There is no such thing as “agency” in an emergent system rooting in first principle. What mechanism would be capable of forcing a mathematical abstraction onto physical systems. How can any physical pro- cess take note of any mathematical abstract notion of oscillation and behave accordingly? Well, it can not, it only appears to stabilize each time while in reality, as we will show, the collapse is a ongoing process and quantized in discrete pulses. The mathematical structure is emerging from first principles from within the physical structure, it can be derived from observation.

But first why chords do not resize absolutely, only relatively. In the QGF configuration the length of the chords of each n-gon is cl n = 2 n × c n and approaches a length of 2 π , lim n →∞ cl n = 2 π . This limit to the chord length is the key that allows us to define a physical model from which the QGF as first principle emerges and by this the foundation under the otherwise unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in modeling the observed universe and its physical interactions. 7.3 The natural state as repository of poten- tial The n-chords in the QGF have their own “orbits” at the geometric radius x = 4 n 2 . 5 2 = n × 0 . 16 (relative to the pole at 25 25 ). All QGF chords are periodic chords, but will only be revealed as such when expressed by a modulated repository of potential. In the physical implementation of the QGF the pole at x = 2 . 5 2 is absolute, it represents the outer limit of a complete convex set. In figure 7.3 the horizontal shaded bar encloses a vertical range, y = [( 2 π × sin ( π 3 )) , 2 π ] and stretches over the range x = [ π, ∞ ]. The lower end is b = 2 π × sin ( π 3 ) because the chord at c = 2 π is in fact the 90 ° orthogonal chord at infinity projected as a hexagonal chord under 60 ° . Herein we find the two configurations responsible for the 90 ° vs 60 ° as mentioned under section 7.2.5. The whole range between the pole and infinity gets confined to the maximum radius x = 2 π and the accumulated sum translates, because orthogonal, to A = (2 π ) 2 = 4 × π 2 . At coordinate x=1, the circle has a circumference of c = 2 π . This is to be considered the chord at infinity as shown on the right of the picture at x = ∞ . The chord at infinity is the evolution of the circle at x=1. The remaining chords at n = [2 , ∞〉 progressively project at a steeper angle until at the limit, lim n →∞ ∠ π n = 90 ° all chords stack up to an infinite line orthogonal to the x-axis, a circle of sorts, just like the circle at coordinate 1 is a line of sorts. 7.3.1 A box of chords Figure 7.3 shows that all chords fit the box, the maximum length is lim n →∞ 2 n × sin ( 2 π 2 n ) = 2 π .

The question is how to confine the infinite set of chords to C box , and more pressing (no pun intended), how to fit for example a 10-gon in a 6-gon box. Compression is the answer to surplus chords , in table 7.2 the column n starts at n=6. In their geometric identity all chords for n¡7 can be inscribed n times at x=n. The chords for n¿6 that are part of the same set do not fit any other x-coordinate because the QGF framework is designed this way, absolute position, abso- lute size, each chord represents a unique coordinate. The column x n in table 7.2 lists the calculated length of the chords at their designated geometric x coordinate, starting with x n = 6 and thereafter the chords get progressively larger. The chord at n = ∞ is exactly 2 π and allows for a hexagon with radius r = 2 π to fit inside the pole. This means that each x n fits the C box as hexagon at coordinate x n .

Each chord is part of a hexagon representing a snare compressed into to n-6 integer parts that define the harmonic to which the snare is tuned. In fact there are n radii that define a circumference behaving like a “particle in a box” configuration. Figure 7.5 shows a particle in a box and quantum harmonic oscillator configuration. The n-chords n¿6 exist on their own unique radius between x=6 and x = 2 π . For each radius the resulting chord length is unique, ( ∀ n > 6) ( ∃ ! x ∈ R ) ( 2 π x ∈ 〈 6 , 2 π ] ) . The first possible fit is a hexagon, the radius defines the chord length and hence the compression factor. This sets up a stack of hexagons that in the surplus chords mimic the configuration of a quantum harmonic oscillator with energy level n surplus . The layers are tuned to the integer surplus for each hexagon, see table 7.2, but that integer surplus defines n-chords that are unique real values x n = 2 n × sin ( 2 π 2 n ) . E.g. The 7-chord projects geomet- rically beyond x = 2 . 5 2 .

The largest n-gon in the QGF that fits the circumference is the 6-gon, this is the lowest energy state equivalent in a physical setting, fits snug without surplus to bounce around. Given a repository of potential with a infinitely hard rigid border, the ultimate particle in a box example must be the universe itself."

QUADRATURE GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK Figure 7.5: Particle in a box and Harmonic oscillator 7.4 Prime interference The surplus as listed in table 7.2 is at first glance represented by the set of Natural numbers N , but column x n tells a different story.

Like tuning a snare on an instrument the “surplus” can be envisioned as a measure of tension on the string. Note that in abstract geometric sense there is no such thing as a C box , all n-gons occupy there natural coordinate, “fit snugly” and have no “surplus” chords. The relative density is given by the quotient ρ n = x n x 6 and of vital importance. Unlike n ∈ N the surplus consists of values that are not unit values but are more prime-like. It is as if putting the primes in one to one correspondence with the natural numbers, but not by assigning a number, in stead grouping those primes in n copies, as in matrix [eq:chord-"

The set of chords within a n-gon are equivalent but differ from all other chords in the QGF. The hexagonal struc- ture splits those n-chords per diagonal over 6 chords and gives the relative density ρ n for each diagonal, forming a string with a specific density. This specific density in physical sense is of vital importance, the resonance fre- quencies of such ‘strings’ can be equated to the set of prime numbers among the Natural numbers , each chord acts like a snare uniquely tuned for the n-gon. The comparison with prime numbers is a valid one, be it that ev- ery hexagon consists of 6 chords of that specific density. Naively one could make the comparison that electrons, all possessing the same set of properties could be modeled by a n-gon of the size n-electrons in the universe. The QGF is broader than representing one singular set, a less naive representa- tion is forthcoming. All being well, but can the assumption of a repository of potential structured like the QGF be verified in natural systems. 7.4.1 Observations This specific density is probably linked to observed features like present in hexagonal basalt, the fracture pattern of gradually dried mud planes or for instance the hexagonal features at the north pole of Saturn. A volatile en- vironment comes slowly to rest and at certain point the system organizes into an equilibrium. Mud flats dry out faster than a few 1000 m 3 m 3 of basalt cools down, the hexagonal structure is more obvious in columnar basalt than in the crack pattern of a mud plane. The specific pattern at Saturn’s north pole exists in a rather volatile atmosphere as the pattern is thought to be caused by jet streams and can be modeled to appear in simulations of at- mospheric conditions. The more granular the subset, the less obvious the hexagonal equilibrium. Recognizing any odd pattern is part of being human, so we need a process to connect the dots. Geometrically we can appreciate numerical indicators that might be labeled as “density” , but a label does not cause behavior."

A propagating wave on one n-gon can reroute, either temporarily or periodically during density fluctuations. This dynamic enables strings that in the base state differ in density to transfer potential, to and fro notably quantified in character. Of course for something to fluctuate it needs to exist. Particle accelerators collide blobs of energy, those do ex- ist, scientist wack those blobs and study the way the energy dissipates. But what do those “blobs” consist off is the question we hope to answer. The link between the abstraction of chords and physics can be made via the pair correlation function. 7.5.1 Pair correlation In 1972 at the Institute of Advanced Study Freeman Dyson and Hugh Mont- gomery compared notes. Hugh Montgomery found that 1 − ( sin ( πx ) πx ) 2 is the theoretical prediction for two-point correlations in the distribution of the ze- ros of the Riemann zeta function. According to Freeman Dyson 1 − ( sin ( πx ) πx ) 2 states exactly the pair-correlation for the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix and for the energy levels in a heavy nucleus like U-238.

T 6 = 21 is the number of chords (including for n=1) that project inside the pole, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21. From zero Z 21 to zero Z 111 is exactly 90 zeta zeros. 111 is not a triangular number, the triangular numbers nearest to 111 are T 14 = 105 ∆ − 6 and T 15 = 120 ∆9. This positions Z 111 at a 6 9 ratio. This is recognizable in the ζ (2) configura- tion of the triangular plane and shows the mechanism of the continuously decreasing surface area encoded in the zeta zeros. The area inside the QGF pole is represented by the 21 zeta zeros in level 1 and therefor all chords that project inside the pole for every scale invariant natural state of the QGF are represented. 7.7.2 Interlaced zeta and repulsion Each of the levels has a fixed number of zeros and a fixed range in which the zeros project, this is illustrated in figure 7.11. It is in the projection of level 1, Z 2 L 1 x = 1 . 070703948 → Z 21 L 1 x = 1 . 492250102 that the charac- teristic level repulsion, pattern of spacing between zeta zeros begins to show. Interlaced zeta zeros The progression of the levels as seen in figure 7.10 shows that the lower range becomes progressively denser. Level 2 Z 22 L 2 x = 1 . 005849367 → Z 111 L 2 x = 1 . 332429741 only starts intruding into Level 1 at Z 33 L 2 x = 1 . 072498831 as it projects past Z 2 L 1 x = 1 . 070703948. 7.7.3 Naturally in pieces All the natural numbers are interlaced in parts. For every n ∈ N there are n zeta zeros representing that number that diffusely interlace on the real axis. The number of zeta zeros is an area A = lim n →∞ T n → 1 2 N 2 and each zero is an area the size of 1 n , e.g. to represent the number n=7, 7 uniquely sized Z 0 project on the real axis, not as a continuous string of zeros, but spread out as dots on a rubber sheet, like galaxies spreading with the expansion of space. As shown in figure ?? this is not a loosely formulated analogy, it is a quite accurate description of the process involved. The figure shows the geometric spreading of zeta zeros where the first zero on the left of level 1 is from number n = 2 → Z 2 = 1 . 070703984. The eight squares on level 2, making up the range for number n = 8 → Z 29 = 1 . 051002249 to Z 36 = 1 . 089959968 enclose also one of two zeros for number n = 2 → Z 2 but not n = 2 → Z 3 . In fact there are more numbers interlaced in the range for n = 8 \u0004 . From the first 950 zeta zeros (up to 9 decimal places suffices in this region), 134 zeros spread over the first 4 levels are included in the range n = 8 → Z 29 to Z 36 ."

The diagonals must depict a unique sequence of area that can be equated to a natural number, but as seen that area gets stretched out, fragmented beyond recognition. But seemingly not ad infinitum so, it is like a shifting panel of affected area (figure 7.11). What happens is that when a larger range is selected, observed granularity increases proportionally. In fact we know of such a property occurring in the physical realm and we alluded to it before, it is the expansion of space itself. It seems that with the expansion of space the energy content does not get diluted, local conditions remain stable while space expands into oblivion. What is proposed here is not to interpret the measured effect as “expansion of space”, but as artifact of observing space from a regressing surface area. One that continuously decreases its radial distance to the singularity at the center, but expressed as a phase shift that enforces local parameters to maintain stability. e.g. similar to the constant temperature at the melting point of water ice, or boiling point of water. Se- lecting a greater subset by application of some arbitrary coordinate system increases local granularity relative to that coordinate system. This intuition seems confirmed by figures 7.10 and 7.11 as it is clear that the levels con- dense ever increasing sets of zeta zeros in proportionally compacter stretches"

What seems to be the case is that prime numbers are in some sense coordinates on the M-brane mono-surface from where the horizon encloses rational fractions of the available space. It seems that prime numbers are defined by being rational multiples of zeta zeros, and not just rational multiples, but groups of multiples in specific order that exactly match some set of units shaping some exact curvature of (prime) unit surface area. The conclusion must be that although n ∈ N are seen as the sum of equal partitions, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 . . . each 1 of them is one of a kind and has a specific size (area / curvature). E.g. (2 − 1) 6 = (3 − 2) 6 = (4 − 3) 6 = (5 − 4) ... Those spaces together are responsible for the expanding surface area, filling the diagonal of the triangular plane c = √ 2 × lim n →∞ T n √ 2 level by level, each level unique in number and spread of zeta zeros. 7.7.4 Prime like distribution for all n This of course means that the zeta zeros by themselves say nothing special about the distribution of primes. Each level spreads the represented natural numbers out over that level in n parts. E.g L 1 = { 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 } = 20 zeros. The cumulative effect is the apparent accretion of surface area as found in the projection plane model. The zeta zeros by their triangular distribution represent an area A = lim n →∞ T n → 1 2 N 2 , the area fills up over the diagonal as { Z 0 } , { Z 1 , Z 2 } , { Z 3 , Z 4 , Z 5 } , { Z 6 , Z 7 , Z 8 , Z 9 } , ... see matrix [eq:n-in-pieces]. Returning to the triangular plane and its diagonal c = √ 2 × lim n →∞ T n √ 2, at the end only N remains but yes, the zeta zeros all line up on that diagonal, because in the triangular projection all of them lay on the diagonal of the triangular plane. In the limit the whole N of them, any natural number, prime or not. QED for the Riemann hypothesis, at least for as far as the QGF goes. It is a bit frustrating to look at this picture and realize that the nth (prime) number is distributed over that area in n parts, infinitely diffuse in spread, how many time one wonders “where the (expletive) does that number live”. The geometric primes as n-gon are as prime as it gets. But how to make the connection between prime numbers having a specific location in N , the distinct x coordinate for the geometric primes and the, ever shifting, distribution of the zeta zeros. One answer is that the zeta zeros are even more prime than the geometric primes, literally so because ∀ n ∈ N ∃ n × Z n → # Z n = [ T n − ( n − 1) , T n ] e.g.n = 3 → T 3 = 6 → { Z 4 , Z 5 , Z 6 } , 3 zeros each representing a unique chord as we are about to see."

The QGF chords resemble geometric primes in abstract sense, none divides the other, each can be seen as a uniquely tuned string. The zeta zeros however do something different in the sense that they clearly define a n-gon that is not regular, but has ever increasing chord length defined by consecutive zeta zeros. Unlike the geometric chords that describe those of a hexagon, the chords represented by the zeta zeros have a slightly higher value for each converted zero. The zeros are grouped according to the triangular schema, but each zeta zero produces a unique chord length. Because of this unique chord length the zeta zeros cannot form a regular n-gon. We know however by the triangular order that they are n-gon like. One interpretation is that the deflection of the angles is as expected for an n-gon ∠ θ = 2 π n , and thus the discrepancy in size must be due to “departing the circumscribed arc at ∠ θ ” under condition of a actively shrinking radius and “landing on the circumscribed arc at ∠ θ ” . This is what is modeled in figure 7.15. The zeta zeros follow some intermediate path that seem to describe chords of a spiral that for each set add up to 360 degrees, see matrix [eq:zeta-angle-"

Each 6 3 × 3 = 6 9 block shows a upper right value that is there as chain link to the left lower cell of the following block, indicating the chain along the diagonal. Thus a diagonal of 7 primes plus the initial lower left 1 is formed summing up to 1 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 = 96. The total of primes in this 8 × 8 = 64 configuration sum op to 100 (excluding the lower left 1), including primes 2 and 3 not on the orthogonal diagonal. This gives a 96 100 ratio that we register as the primorial delta P ∆ = 24 25 . The pattern follows figure 4.9 in its stacking of affected area,  { [1] , [2 , 3] , [4 , 5 , 6] }  { [7] , [8 , 9] , [10 , 11 , 12] }  { [13] , [14 , 15] , [16 , 17 , 18] }  { [19] , [20 , 21] , [22 , 23 , 24] } and causes the primes { 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 19 , 23 } to line up along the diagonal. In the next image, 7.18, on the left the ordening of the zeta zeros is superimposed on the triangular plane. On the right we find numerically a bad fit for the stack of primes to the zeta zero indices, however, the affected area did not change, merely a swapping of square units occurred . Orthogonal succession The zeta zeros are projected in their ‘natural’ n-gon position.

The sum of the values on the diagonal is d p = 96 or 12 × 8, the proportional area of a square with a diagonal d p = 96 → A prop = ( 96 √ 2 − 1 ) 2 = 4608.

But this aside, the patterns of figure 7.22 are drawn on a Cartesian plane representing volume. Table 8.1 lays out a two dimensional array that extends to 50 rows and columns of U arc . The U arc = 7 . 2 ° ensures that 50 iterations suffice to complete a full cycle, ∠ U arc → [7 . 2 ° ,360 ° ]. The variable q ∈ Q determines the value for which 50 2 = 2500 data points represent intersecting radii. The radius subdivides into units 1 2 . 5 2 = 8 50 . The proportion 50 2 ∝ 8 2 models the reduction in volume as function of surface area. Table 8.1 represents just one out of an infinite number of gradients that represent a 8-fold increase in volume. The proportion 2500 ∝ 64 can also be stated as the circumference of a circle with radius | 2 π | , the limit of mapping the zeta function to a circumference, see table 2.2, c = | 2 π |× 2 π # 2 = 39 1 16 = 2500 64 . 8.1 Interval, chaos and strange attractor Projected as a 50 × 50 surface, enhanced with a gradient, the spectrum of the 50 2 = 2500 possible intersections per unique value tells a story that culminates with a primorial connection.

If all changes in relation with all other things, then at first glance no change occurs. Taking a closer look at figure 7.19, the set of diag- onals D 0 , D 1 , D 2 provide some answers that connect the QGF intimately with the primorial function.

At this point we only have a first principle that might account for the emergence of a quantum harmonic oscillator in a complete convex set when the abstraction of the QGF is superimposed on that set. How does one account for a repository of potential that, by observation and experimen- tation, has real tactile properties, spatial and temporal qualities. It is not sufficient to ‘declare’ such a space into existence and explain its properties in terms of (analogies to) the QGF. Wikipedia: Energy In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 meter against a force of 1 newton. Spatial qualities are in fact non existent. The QGF models a dimensionless point that can neither expand nor col- lapse. But we observe both collapse and expansion at all conceivable scales, so how to account for spatial displacement if, as proposed, there are no such things as spatial qualities in the dimensionless point. There is no mystery here, looking out into the universe is receiving signals from times long gone. The M-brane mono surface stretches out in time, is in a excited state and is in a entropic process similar to a dampened oscillator eventually coming to absolute rest. Yes, “absolute” in clear defiance of the zero point energy"

It is the nature of circumstances that led to the observation that energy evidently is conserved and must be some eternal quantity that can not be destroyed. The repos- itory of potential that we occupy is structured such that observation must led to that conclusion. Then what is it? The Planck constant represents the staccato transfer of potential from unity chord to unity chord at some point of equilibrium as if part of a zone of constant pressure in a shock wave. A continuous gradient of collapsing surface area. It is at the front of a shock wave that we envision the conditions that at first sight energy, and by ex- tension information, is preserved. The universe that we experience to be a spatial realm, expanding in time, is in fact an illusion of ever decreasing ‘surface area’. This surface area that we are part of close to atomic scale, has a cross section that stretches out from the Planck scale to the center of the great voids at universal scale. This thin layer of activity is the M-brane mono surface coming to rest by shifting potential from layer to layer, the absolute surface area of the bow shock reduces with the radius, and us observers are integral part of that surface. It is space that apparently expands in rela- tion to that for the observer static surface area, but in fact is just an illusion caused by re-configuring potential. Spatial qualities are an illusion of shifting potential traversing the zero dimensional point. This equilibrium at the bow shock is our universe, a phase transition akin to a boiling kettle of water, a constant 100 ° C until there is nothing to evaporate left. At which point the bow shock ran its course, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is no more and the potential called “time” reduced to nothing. Wikipedia: to interpret UN (the vibrational energy of N oscillators) not as a continuous, infinitely divisible quantity, but as a discrete quantity composed of an integral number of finite equal parts. Let us call each such part the energy element – Planck, On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum 8.5 The size of the mathematical universe Our mathematical universe, given the 8 units on D 0 , has the definite size of A = 8 × 8 = 64. Not every angle, line or pattern, no matter how appealing, has to have structural meaning in the context of this thesis. Humans are pattern seeking animals by evolutionary necessity and find patterns even where non exist. D 0 , D 1 and D 2 represent areas by triangular projection. In the limit of the triangular projection we are left with a field of dimensionless points, a surface which only structure exists by the linear relation of the natural numbers, a line for short. In this context we are justified to interpret"

As shown in figure 8.4, there exist a configuration at which those two diagonals line up, and in essence represent the diagonal BHD in figure 7.8 at the point of equilibrium. In figure 6.3, line AG = √ 2, the longest line in our universe is a diagonal of a square. All this we find sufficient corroboration to postulate the size of our (mathematical) universe. But then again, “64” is not that poetic standing there alongside “42”, no cult status just yet. So let us see what 64 has to offer, maybe a slice of history is possible. Taken the sum of primes as line AG = √ 2, the we find A universe = ( 100 √ 2 ) 2 = 5000, and this provides us with a universal unit of area A 1 = 1 64 5000 = 78 . 125, this all is a bit nondescript until we unlock some beautiful relation and take some time to ponder on the following. ◦ A 5 = π 5 2 = 78 . 53981634 \u0005 A 4 = ( 2 . 5 2 √ 2 ) 2 = 78 . 125 ◦ A 5 \u0005 A 4 = # 2 (8.2)"
